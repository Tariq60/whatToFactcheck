138	231	Climate Change: Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen.
1328	1490	But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited.
2195	2606	Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock.

At the time, he said "the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change," because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say.
3802	3953	They failed to predict a decade-long pause in global temperatures. Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized.
4088	4340	Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been conducting highly suspicious temperature data manipulation. The changes in the temperature data consistently make the past seem cooler, which in turn makes the present seem warmer.
