358	709	Collapsing polar ice caps, a green Sahara Desert, a 20-foot sea-level rise. 

That's the potential future of Earth, a new study suggests, noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.

The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history.
857	1066	This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.
1438	1520	In looking at Earth's past, scientists can predict what the future will look like.
1917	2320	Human-inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere.

Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two.
2500	3108	But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change."

The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.

However, Meissner said "we cannot comment on how far in the future these changes will occur."

Referring to the study findings, lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, there is "very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”
