17	164	Scorching Earth: Global warming to blame for all-time heat records being set worldwide, as experts warn stifling temperatures will continue to soar
212	284	Global heatwave stretches across the majority of the Northern hemisphere
425	498	The distribution of the heatwaves points to global warming as the culprit
582	951	Stifling heat cracked roads and buckled roofs across Britain last week, as Motherwell hit the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland at 91.8°F (33.2°C). 

The heatwave has spread across the world, with Meteo France placing 21 departments across the country on an orange weather alert, while Oman saw the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet.
1228	1482	While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.

Records all around the world have been shattered as the entire planet is in the grips of a vicious heatwave.
1868	2404	The scale of this latest phenomenon suggests global warming is to blame, scientists have cautioned.

'Summers keep getting hotter,' said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.

'Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.

'If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.'
3279	3482	On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.

But despite this, the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.
7613	8061	Quriyat, in Oman, also recorded the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet, hitting 121.6°F (49°C) on June 26, falling just two degrees short of the all-time heat record for the country, which stands at 123.4°F (50.7°C).  

The latest records come months after Pakistan posted the hottest temperature ever seen on Earth.

The sun was so intense, it took the mercury up to in excess of 120°F as it topped out at 122.4 °F (50.2°C).
