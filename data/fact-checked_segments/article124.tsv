20	94	Media Hysteria: Climate Change 'Heat Records' Are a Huge Data Manipulation
130	288	The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.
474	812	On Feb. 7, several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record.

Sadly, these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jibe with reality over the past 140 years.

The same climate experts warn that record heat is just the tip of the iceberg.
1218	1345	Actual weather records over the past 100 years show no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.
1796	1878	Did the Earth experience its highest temperature ever this year? The answer is no.
2153	2327	The coldest temperature ever reported was 129 degrees below zero Fahrenheit in Vostok, Antarctica, in 1983, when Carbon dioxide emissions were five times higher than in 1913.
3166	3314	These examples all illustrate that cherry picking record high temperatures in isolated locations tells absolutely nothing about the Earth’s climate.
3384	3502	The strongest heat wave ever recorded occurred in July 1936, generating high temperatures in half of America’s states.
3848	4055	In terms of general behavior, the global warming alarmist prediction is that as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.
4167	4315	Concurrently a compilation of all days since 1915 when temperatures exceeded 90F shows them decreasing with time rather than increasing in Figure 2.
4392	4774	Once again, the data does not support the claim that the United States is hotter than ever as a result of rising Carbon dioxide levels.

From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement. However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase.
4874	4989	These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats which measure ocean temperatures at a variety of depths.
5080	5181	Isn’t it time to start ignoring the calamitous annual claims that this is the hottest year on record?
