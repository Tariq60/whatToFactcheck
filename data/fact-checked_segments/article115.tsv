1485	1744	According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average. This puts us well over halfway to the ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5˚ C (2.7˚F) set in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement.
2180	2316	El Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean — which tends to drive up global temperatures.
2399	2512	La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific, and tend to cool the planet down.
2929	3382	Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic. The Antarctic, which was trending at record high levels just a few years ago, reached a record low during 2017, with ice covering 154,000 fewer square miles than the previous record low set in 1986.

In the Arctic, sea ice extent was the second-lowest since records began in 1979, behind only 2016, though record low sea ice was observed during the winter months of January-March.
