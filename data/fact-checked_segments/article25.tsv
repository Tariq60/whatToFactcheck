197	299	Higher temperatures, we’re told, will be deadly—killing “thousands to tens of thousands” of Americans.
487	582	It also ignores inconvenient evidence—like the fact that cold kills many more people than heat.
946	1094	But correspondingly, climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.
1111	1240	Consider a rigorous study published last year in the journal Lancet that examined temperature-related mortality around the globe.
1494	2567	The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration. But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures. In the U.S. about 9,000 people die from heat each year but 144,000 die from cold.

The administration’s new report refers to this study—it would be difficult to ignore, since it is the world’s largest—but only in trivial ways, such as to establish the relationship between temperature and mortality. Not once does this “scientific assessment” acknowledge that cold deaths significantly outweigh heat deaths.

The report confidently claims that when temperatures rise, “the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States.” Six footnotes are attached to that statement.
3212	3300	Most cold deaths actually occur during moderate temperatures, as the Lancet study shows.
5001	5167	In pushing too hard for the case that global warming is universally bad for everything, the administration’s report undermines the reasonable case for climate action.
5258	5573	Although there is a robust intellectual debate on heat and cold deaths, there is a much simpler way to gauge whether people in the U.S. consider higher temperatures preferable: Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.
