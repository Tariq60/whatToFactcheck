17	78	‘Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice’
229	381	He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.
1060	1672	Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline. Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.
1748	1855	People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change.
1971	2010	One key effect will be albedo feedback.
2524	2628	These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.
2931	3130	The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely.
3672	3810	Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed.
4248	4434	Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution.
