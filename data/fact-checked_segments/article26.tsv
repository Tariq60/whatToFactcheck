14	97	Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s as ocean temperatures skyrocket, study finds
128	695	Australia's Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's greatest reservoirs of biodiversity. 

A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures, which is causing widespread coral bleaching that is damaging and, in some cases, even killing the reefs. 

Now a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, "large parts" of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.
2535	2747	The analysis' findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die-off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050, as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems.
6797	7060	The projection that much of the Great Barrier Reef could perish within the next few decades could turn out to be too pessimistic, since other research has shown that some species of corals are surprisingly resilient to the stress from changing ocean temperatures.
7793	7923	"We flew for 4,000 kilometers in the most pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef, and saw only four reefs that had no bleaching.
8005	8291	The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.
