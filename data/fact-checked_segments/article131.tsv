45	131	A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message.
587	1235	The geological archive reveals that Earthâ€™s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are expe-riencing a period of warming. Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.

Warming is far slower than predicted
The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change.
1448	1536	In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmos-phere with CO2 is beneficial.
1588	1649	CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth.
1680	1880	More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.
1933	2284	There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more fre-quent. However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.
2348	2378	There is no climate emergency.
2515	2589	If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt.
