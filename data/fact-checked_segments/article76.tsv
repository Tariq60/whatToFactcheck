15	83	Climate Scientists: Climate Models Have Overestimated Global Warming
115	730	A new report published by a team of prominent climate scientists confirms what many skeptics have pointed out for years: the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming “hiatus,” over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures.

The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the “slowdown” in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 “emissions budget” for the coming decades.
898	1427	The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming “hiatus” in the beginning of the 21st century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases, consequently setting key benchmarks for warming earlier than they need to be, given the actual numbers.

“The models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions,” University of Exerter’s Pierre Friedlingstein, one of the study’s authors, told The Washington Post.
2010	2232	The report follows a study by another team of climate scientists published in June 2017 that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was “generally smaller than trends estimated” from the models.
