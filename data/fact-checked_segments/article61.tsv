125	249	The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule, a new study finds.
466	663	“Because it’s getting warmer, there’s more CO2 coming out which means it’s going to get warmer which means there’s more CO2 coming out,” explained Harvard researcher and lead author Roisin Commane.
1116	1482	“We find that Alaska, overall, was a net source of carbon to the atmosphere during 2012–2014,” the study concludes. Data from NOAA’s Barrow Alaska station “indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975, supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2.”
1978	2075	Thawing permafrost can release not just CO2, but also methane, a much stronger heat-trapping gas.
