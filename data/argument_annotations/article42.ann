T1	MajorClaim 128 208	the Great Barrier Reef, just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded
T3	Claim 360 491	Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off
T6	Premise 792 906	In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most "pristine," some 67% of the coral died
T7	Premise 909 1008	The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better
T13	Premise 1673 1803	When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color
T14	Claim 1806 1914	Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up
T15	Claim 1917 2016	Besides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species
T16	Premise 2020 2189	Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on,
T17	Premise 2257 2421	These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few
T23	Premise 2922 3034	If all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda
