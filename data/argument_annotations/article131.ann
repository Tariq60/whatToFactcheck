T3	Claim 224 332	Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggera-tions in their predictions of global warming
T6	Claim 587 718	The geological archive reveals that Earthâ€™s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases
T7	Premise 720 764	The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850
T8	Claim 777 844	it is no surprise that we now are expe-riencing a period of warming

T11	Premise 990 1171	The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance
T12	Claim 1173 1234	It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change
T14	Claim 1280 1364	Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools
