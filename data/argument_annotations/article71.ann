T1	Claim 104 283	Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal: If global warming is “real,” both sides of the debate seem to assume, the climate lobby’s policy agenda follows inexorably
T2	Claim 286 297	It does not
T3	MajorClaim 299 460	Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively analyzing economic costs and the actual, rather than symbolic, benefits of their policies
T4	Claim 462 545	Skeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis
T5	Claim 548 658	To arrive at a wise policy response, we first need to consider how much economic damage climate change will do
T6	Premise 660 763	Current models struggle to come up with economic costs commensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric
T7	Premise 765 851	Typical costs are well below 10% of gross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond
T9	Premise 906 995	Even 10% less GDP in 100 years corresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth
T10	Claim 997 1098	Climate change therefore does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth
T11	Claim 1100 1220	If the goal is 10% more GDP in 100 years, pro-growth tax, regulatory and entitlement reforms would be far more effective
T12	Claim 1223 1259	Yes, the costs are not evenly spread
T14	Premise 1312 1406	The American South might be a worse place to grow wheat; Southern Canada might be a better one
T15	Premise 1408 1518	In a century, Miami might find itself in approximately the same situation as the Dutch city of Rotterdam today
T16	Claim 1548 1613	the costs of moving and adapting are not as imposing as they seem
T17	Claim 1615 1672	Rotterdam’s dikes are expensive, but not prohibitively so
T18	Premise 1674 1721	Most buildings are rebuilt about every 50 years
T19	Premise 1723 1862	If we simply stopped building in flood-prone areas and started building on higher ground, even the costs of moving cities would be bearable
T20	Claim 1864 1883	Migration is costly
T22	Claim 1968 2047	Allowing people to move to better climates in the 21st will be equally possible
T23	Premise 2049 2202	Such investments in climate adaptation are small compared with the investments we will regularly make in houses, businesses, infrastructure and education
T24	Claim 2209 2242	economics is the central question
T25	Claim 2312 2348	Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health
T26	Claim 2350 2370	It’s good for plants
T27	Claim 2372 2411	Climate change need not endanger anyone
T28	Claim 2413 2592	If it did—and you do hear such claims—then living in hot Arizona rather than cool Maine, or living with Louisiana’s frequent floods, would be considered a health catastrophe today
T29	Claim 2595 2648	Global warming is not the only risk our society faces
T30	Claim 2650 2821	Even if science tells us that climate change is real and man-made, it does not tell us, as President Obama asserted, that climate change is the greatest threat to humanity
T33	Claim 2927 2929	No
T34	Claim 2931 3073	Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow, widely predicted, relatively small economic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis
T35	Claim 3075 3125	Societies do fall apart from war, disease or chaos
T36	Claim 3127 3211	Climate policy must compete with other long-term threats for always-scarce resources
T37	Claim 3214 3276	Facing this reality, some advocate that we buy some “insurance
T38	Claim 3279 3377	Sure, they argue, the projected economic cost seems small, but it could turn out to be a lot worse
T39	Claim 3379 3429	But the same argument applies to any possible risk
T40	Claim 3431 3520	If you buy overpriced insurance against every potential danger, you soon run out of money
T41	Claim 3522 3707	You can sensibly insure only when the premium is in line with the risk—which brings us back where we started, to the need for quantifying probabilities, costs, benefits and alternatives
T44	Claim 3835 3938	Strategic waiting is a rational response to a slow-moving uncertain peril with fast-changing technology
T45	Claim 3941 4004	Global warming is not even the obvious top environmental threat
T46	Claim 4006 4113	Dirty water, dirty air and insect-borne diseases are a far greater problem today for most people world-wide
T47	Claim 4115 4190	Habitat loss and human predation are a far greater problem for most animals
T48	Premise 4192 4239	Elephants won’t make it to see a warmer climate
T50	Claim 4372 4439	we need to know what effect proposed policies have and at what cost
T51	Claim 4441 4588	Scientific, quantifiable or even vaguely plausible cause-and-effect thinking are missing from much advocacy for policies to reduce carbon emissions
T52	Premise 4590 4855	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s “scientific” recommendations, for example, include “reduced gender inequality & marginalization in other forms,” “provisioning of adequate housing,” “cash transfers” and “awareness raising & integrating into education
T53	Claim 4898 4980	they are not scientifically valid, cost-benefit-tested policies to cool the planet
T54	Claim 4983 5052	Climate policy advocates’ apocalyptic vision demands serious analysis
T59	Claim 5543 5635	And it follows that symbolic, ineffective, political grab-bag policies should be intolerable
