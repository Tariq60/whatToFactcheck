T1	MajorClaim 154 389	A new report has warned there's an existential risk to humanity from the climate crisis within the coming decades, and a "high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end" over the next three decades unless urgent action is taken
T2	Claim 392 634	The report, published by Australian thinktank the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration, outlines an apocalyptic scenario that could see conditions "beyond the threshold of human survivability" across much of our planet by 2050
T4	Claim 767 839	The report refuses to downplay its bleak assessment of what could happen
T5	Claim 1091 1161	we are now in a unique situation with no precise historical equivalent
T8	Claim 1480 1535	they propose a plausible and terrifying "2050 scenario"
T9	Premise 1636 1797	Governments fail to act on the evidence that the Paris Agreement isn't enough to keep Earth's temperature from rising, and will "lock in at least 3°C of warming"
T10	Premise 1799 1942	As projected by previous studies, carbon dioxide levels have reached 437 parts per million, which hasn't been seen in the last 20 million years
T13	Premise 2040 2129	carbon cycle feedbacks and the continued use of fossil fuels see temperatures rise by 3°C
T14	Premise 2154 2360	By 2050 there's a scientific consensus that we reached the tipping point for ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic well before 2°C (3.6°F) of warming, and for widespread permafrost at 2.5°C (4.5°F)
T15	Premise 2362 2462	A "Hothouse Earth" scenario plays out that sees Earth's temperatures doomed to rise by a further 1°C
T16	Claim 2514 2561	At this point the human impact is off the scale
T17	Premise 2622 2709	more than 20 days a year of lethal heat conditions beyond that which humans can survive
T18	Premise 2733 2755	extreme weather events
T19	Premise 2801 2913	Monsoons in China fail, the great rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls by half
T20	Premise 2916 2957	Deadly heat conditions across West Africa
T21	Premise 3111 3147	Food production is severely affected
T23	Premise 3339 3365	pandemic disease outbreaks
T24	Premise 3385 3415	Armed conflicts over resources
T26	Claim 3605 3661	"high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end"
T28	Claim 4079 4091	It is doable

T3	SuperAnnotatorClaim 1273 1378	This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities
T6	SuperAnnotatorClaim 1383 1457	learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks

T11	SuperAnnotatorClaim 3238 3288	The knock-on consequences affect national security
T12	SuperAnnotatorPremise 3293 3383	the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic disease outbreaks, are overwhelming
T22	SuperAnnotatorPremise 3385 3489	Armed conflicts over resources may become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war
T25	SuperAnnotatorClaim 4213 4279	There are ways we can prevent this future, we just need to act now
