T1	MajorClaim 236 370	the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming “hiatus,
T2	Premise 496 604	acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the “slowdown” in warming post-2000
T4	MajorClaim 731 895	The report in part intends to “reset” the estimations for the new predictions on when the earth will hit what the U.N. has determined to be dangerous warming levels
T5	Premise 1021 1220	the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases, consequently setting key benchmarks for warming earlier than they need to be, given the actual numbers
T6	Premise 1224 1324	The models end up with a warming which is larger than the observed warming for the current emissions
T7	Premise 1429 1485	So, therefore, they derive a budget which is much lower,
T8	Claim 1616 1666	the models used by the IPCC have made two mistakes
T10	Premise 1777 1896	These two small discrepancies accumulate over time and lead to an slight underestimation of the remaining carbon budget
T11	Claim 1912 2006	The new study, he said, attempts to “reset the uncertainties, starting from where we are today
T12	Premise 2029 2127	a study by another team of climate scientists published in June 2017 that likewise determined that
T15	Premise 2272 2431	In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble
T16	Premise 2433 2627	Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability, such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur
T18	Claim 2852 3037	We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century, differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability
T19	Premise 3039 3259	Over most of the early twenty-first century, however, model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability
T20	Premise 3261 3446	The probability that multi-decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century results is low (between zero and about 9%)
T21	Premise 3448 3583	It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity
T22	Premise 3585 3794	We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations
T23	Premise 3797 3819	The Daily Caller notes
T26	Premise 4075 4212	Cato Institute scientists Patrick Michaels and Chip Knappenberger have noted the climate models have been over-hyping warming for decades
T27	Premise 4214 4320	Scientist John Christy of the University of Alabama-Huntsville has testified before Congress on the matter
T28	Premise 4327 4444	Christy’s research has shown climate models show 2.5 times more warming in the bulk atmosphere than has been observed
T30	Premise 4618 4760	That study found “satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble
