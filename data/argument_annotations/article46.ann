T1	Premise 142 306	The average temperature across the world’s land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 Fahrenheit, or 1.69 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees, NOAA declared
T2	Premise 308 436	The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000
T3	Premise 438 525	The years 2005 and 2010 were also record warm years, according to the agency’s data set
T4	MajorClaim 569 600	2016 the warmest year on record
T6	Premise 841 984	NASA found a bigger leap upward of temperatures in 2016, measuring the year as .22 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the prior record year of 2015
T7	Premise 986 1091	The agency also noted that since the year 2001, the planet has seen “16 of the 17 warmest years on record
T8	Premise 1106 1166	is remarkably the third record year in a row in this series,
T9	MajorClaim 1260 1349	We don’t expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear
T10	Premise 1353 1552	The record comes two days before Donald Trump, who has tweeted that global warming is a “hoax,” assumes the presidency and, with it, control over the two science agencies that announced these records
T11	Premise 1554 1790	It is also the same day that Scott Pruitt, Trump’s controversial nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency, is appearing before the Senate in an often-tense confirmation hearing in which he has been questioned about climate change
T12	Premise 1792 1880	Pruitt has previously written that the “debate” over climate change is “far from settled
T13	Claim 1884 2268	Trump’s other nominees, such as State Department nominee Rex Tillerson and Interior Department nominee Ryan Zinke, have been less dismissive of climate change in their confirmation hearings, acknowledging at least some human contribution to the phenomenon but also raising questions either about the extent to which it is human-caused or about our capacity to predict the consequences
T14	Premise 2270 2433	On Wednesday, Pruitt acknowledged that climate change is not a “hoax” and said that “the climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner
T15	Claim 2437 2474	Scientists have been far less guarded
T16	Claim 2476 2513	“2016 is a wake-up call in many ways,
T17	MajorClaim 2618 2683	Climate change is real, it is caused by humans, and it is serious
T18	Premise 2785 2892	now concurred on identifying 2014, 2015 and 2016 as, successively, the three warmest years in their records
T19	Claim 2894 3007	There was a noticeable difference this year, however, in how much two agencies judged 2016 to have surpassed 2015
T20	Premise 3009 3030	NASA was more bullish
T22	Premise 3143 3286	The warming in the Arctic has really been exceptional, and what you decide to do when you’re interpolating across the Arctic makes a difference
T23	Claim 3304 3393	But the differences between NOAA and NASA aren’t that significant, Schmidt further argued
T24	Premise 3564 3698	the main take-home response there is that the trends we’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way,”
T26	Claim 3787 3942	Last year’s warmth was partly enhanced by a strong weather pattern known as El Niño, but the federal scientists underscore that this was not the only cause
T27	Premise 4050 4131	but the 2016 planetary temperature now far surpasses the temperature of that year
T28	Premise 4155 4328	The reason is that Earth has been warming since then, allowing another El Niño event, unlocking heat from the vast Pacific Ocean, to push overall temperatures to new heights
T29	Premise 4332 4394	This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third
T34	Premise 5079 5198	2016 was the warmest year on record, albeit only “nominally” because it was very close to 2015 in the agency’s data set
T35	Premise 5200 5362	The center reported that while 2016 was .77 degrees Celsius above the temperature average between 1961 and 1990, 2015 was very close at .76 degrees Celsius higher
T36	Claim 5365 5486	The difference between the Hadley Center and NASA once again comes down to the treatment of the Arctic, Schmidt explained
T37	Premise 5490 5605	Our analysis demonstrates that the Arctic is warming around two to three times as fast as the global mean,” he said
T38	Claim 5607 5740	“So that will be the cause of continuing divergences between the groups, and it ‘s something I think we all need to be thinking about
T39	Premise 5744 5897	NASA further noted in its analysis that compared with the late 19th century, the planet has now warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit
T40	Claim 5899 6103	That’s significant because the global community has been striving to limit overall warming to considerably below a 2 degree Celsius rise, and even, if possible, to hold it to a 1.5 degree Celsius increase
T41	Premise 6105 6174	That is now about .4 degrees away, in Celsius, based on these figures
T42	Premise 6178 6518	It is the second year in a row that the annual global temperature has been more than 1 Celsius degree higher than the pre-industrial level, and shows that the world is moving ever closer to the warming threshold of 1.5 Celsius degrees, beyond which many scientists have concluded the impacts of climate change will be unacceptably dangerous
T43	Premise 6727 6778	Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet
T45	Claim 7135 7231	Among major 2016 events, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef did not stand alone
T46	Premise 7233 7455	In a catalogue of some of the extremes the planet witnessed during the year, NOAA also noted the megafire that engulfed Fort McMurray, in Alberta, Canada, at the beginning of May, relatively early in the year for wildfires
T47	Premise 7457 7702	That event was certainly consistent with a warming climate, as well as with the role of El Niño, although scientists are reluctant to formally say that climate change has played a role in an individual event without conducting extensive analysis
T48	Premise 7705 7971	Extreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit) in May, a new national record — to Iran, where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 F) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22
T49	Premise 7974 8177	For the contiguous United States, 2o16 was merely the second-warmest year on record, but for Alaska, it was the warmest yet recorded, underscoring once again the sharpness of Arctic warmth, in particular
T50	Premise 8180 8257	The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way
T52	Premise 8433 8728	The pattern of record warmth in the lower atmosphere, coupled with record cold in the stratosphere, provides a clear fingerprint of the cause of the unprecedented warming — greenhouse gases trapping heat in the lower atmosphere instead of letting it escape to the stratosphere, and then to space
T54	Claim 8839 9009	All of that said, because of the extreme warmth that occurred early in 2016, the record just announced does not come as much of a surprise to weather and climate watchers
T55	Premise 9011 9057	On April 15, NASA’s Schmidt tweeted: “Too soon
