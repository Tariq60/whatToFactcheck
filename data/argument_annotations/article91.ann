T1	Premise 82 235	Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability
T5	Premise 525 732	Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef
T7	Claim 1095 1212	this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target
T10	Premise 1557 1825	A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering
T12	Premise 2057 2198	The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day
T14	Claim 2335 2389	In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas
T21	Premise 3063 3150	In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products
