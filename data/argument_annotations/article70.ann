T1	Claim 108 287	Normally, the hottest years on record occur when the underlying human-caused global warming trend gets a temporary boost from an El Niño’s enhanced warming in the tropical Pacific
T2	MajorClaim 290 417	So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago
T3	Premise 419 659	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported Tuesday that the first half of 2017 was the second-warmest January-June on record for Earth, topped only by 2016, which was boosted by one of the biggest El Niños on record
T4	Premise 663 796	As if it wasn’t shocking enough to see three consecutive record-breaking years, in 2014, 2015, and 2016, for the first time on record
T7	Premise 1340 1379	This year has been extremely remarkable
T8	Claim 1383 1500	Usually we see global records in years when the short-term El Niño warming adds to the long-term global warming trend
T9	Premise 1520 1692	As NOAA noted in its March report, without an El Niño, no month before March 2017 had ever exceeded the “normal” temperature (the 1981–2010 average) by a full 1.8°F (1.0°C)
T11	Claim 2055 2252	This matters because when a month — or six-month period — sees record high global temperatures in the absence of an El Niño, that is a sign the underlying global warming trend is stronger than ever
T12	Claim 2254 2395	The latest NOAA report is “a reminder that climate change has not, despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘paused’ or even slowed down
T13	MajorClaim 2423 2541	Human-caused global warming continues at a dangerous pace, and only human action to slash carbon pollution can stop it
