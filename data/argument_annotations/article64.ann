T1	MajorClaim 117 298	Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet
T2	Premise 301 546	In the most recent WHO report on air pollution, the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world, significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Austria and France
T3	Premise 639 753	America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population
T4	Premise 756 913	Following standard practice, the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter
T5	Premise 915 1024	These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution
T7	Premise 1411 1495	found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world
T8	Premise 1498 1622	The annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg/m3, the report states
T9	Premise 1624 1856	At the very low end of the spectrum, the United States has a concentration of just 8, while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59, India at 66, Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127
T10	Premise 1860 1991	The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution
T11	Claim 2011 2102	The WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution
T12	Premise 2105 2369	In a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world, the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America, with Chicago coming in second place, Honolulu coming in fourth, and Portland, OR, coming in sixteenth
T13	Premise 2371 2386	Unsurprisingly,
T14	Premise 2448 2620	Similarly, another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China, three cities from Saudi Arabia, and a whopping seven cities from India
T15	Premise 2622 2648	No U.S. city made the list
T16	Premise 2651 2800	A third list, ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world, placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet
T21	Claim 3214 3491	Rather than follow the time-tested practice used by the World Health Organization, which measures levels of disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs, some have played a shell game, swapping a new measure of “pollution” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide
T22	Claim 3567 3595	it is dishonest to say it is
T23	Premise 3597 3648	CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic
T24	Premise 3650 3787	Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever
T25	Premise 3790 3944	Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants
T26	Claim 3947 4103	Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet’s history
T27	Premise 4105 4283	Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm
T28	Claim 4286 4408	Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity
T29	Premise 4410 4569	Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally
T30	Premise 4574 4639	The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain
T31	MajorClaim 4652 4853	While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all
