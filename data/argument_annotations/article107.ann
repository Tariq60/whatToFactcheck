T12	MajorClaim 1157 1230	The brutal weather has been supercharged by human-induced climate change,
T14	Claim 1247 1339	Climate models for three decades have predicted exactly what the world is seeing this summer
T15	Claim 1342 1442	And they predict that it will get hotter — and that what is a record today could someday be the norm
T16	Premise 1470 1526	The old records belong to a world that no longer exists,
T17	Claim 1632 1650	It’s not just heat
T18	Claim 1652 1771	A warming world is prone to multiple types of extreme weather — heavier downpours, stronger hurricanes, longer droughts
T19	Premise 1775 1861	You see roads melting, airplanes not being able to take off, there’s not enough water,
T20	Premise 1951 1996	“Climate change hits us at our Achilles’ heel
T21	Premise 1998 2039	In the Southwest, it’s water availability
T24	Premise 2077 2103	In the East, it’s flooding
T26	Claim 2158 2318	The proximate cause of the Northern Hemisphere bake-off is the unusual behavior of the jet stream, a wavy track of west-to-east-prevailing wind at high altitude
T27	Premise 2320 2414	The jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems
T29	Premise 2511 2626	This summer, the jet stream has undulated in extreme waves that have tended to block weather systems from migrating
T30	Premise 2628 2771	The result has been stagnant high-pressure and low-pressure systems with dire results, such as heat waves in some places and flooding elsewhere
T31	Premise 2774 2963	“When those waves are very big — as they have been for the past few weeks — they tend to get stuck in place,” said Jennifer Francis, a professor of atmospheric science at Rutgers University
T32	Premise 2965 3137	Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit
T34	Claim 3223 3345	Now researchers can examine a weather event and estimate how much climate change had to do with causing or exacerbating it
T35	Premise 3348 3497	Last year, when Hurricane Harvey broke the record for how much rain could fall from a single storm, researchers knew climate change had been a factor
T36	Premise 3500 3645	Months later, scientists presented findings that Harvey dumped at least 15 percent more rain in Houston than it would have without global warming
T37	Claim 3669 3725	When the atmosphere is warmer, it can hold more moisture
T38	Premise 3727 3836	Climate change does not cause hurricanes to spin up or thunderstorms to develop, but it can be an intensifier
T39	Premise 3839 3984	In Dallas, where the temperature hit 100 on 10 out of 11 days this month, three homeless people have died of heat-related causes in the past week
T40	Premise 4063 4256	In Phoenix, where this week’s temperature hit 116 degrees, Dustin Nye, 36, who spent the day installing air-conditioning units, said he has suffered heat stroke in the past and still gets woozy
T43	Premise 4516 4616	It seems like every year, we’ve had some type of temperature anomaly that we normally would not have
T44	Premise 4619 4835	Residents of beach cities such as Long Beach and Santa Monica, who normally rely on the ocean breeze to cool their homes, have added air-conditioning units, which strains the grid and has contributed to power outages
T45	Claim 4847 4859	Said Hayhoe:
T46	Claim 4861 4984	The biggest myth that the largest number of people have bought into is that ‘climate change doesn’t matter to me personally
T47	Premise 4990 5104	The heat waves have hit hard where people don’t expect them — the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain, Ireland and Canada
T48	Premise 5108 5148	Our office doesn’t have air conditioning
T51	Premise 5361 5459	“This kind of event was a 1-in-100-year event in 1900,” he said. “It’s become 20 times more likely
T52	Premise 5463 5526	It’s Britain’s driest summer since modern records began in 1961
T53	Premise 5528 5598	Reservoirs are declining rapidly, and water restrictions are in effect
T54	Premise 5600 5734	The United Kingdom’s national weather service urged people to avoid the sun this week, with temperatures expected to hit 98 Fahrenheit
T55	Premise 5737 5854	In Ireland, the sun-parched fields revealed a previously hidden footprint of a 5,000-year-old monument near Newgrange
T56	Claim 5857 6023	Human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, has added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, trapping heat and making extreme weather events even more extreme
T57	Premise 6025 6230	The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 410 parts per million in May, the highest the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii had measured since Charles David Keeling started keeping records in 1958
T58	Premise 6232 6335	NASA estimates Earth has warmed almost one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s
T59	Premise 6337 6410	Of that, half a degree (around one degree F) has accrued since 1990 alone
T60	Claim 6413 6625	If nothing is done to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, scientists say, the global temperature increase could reach nine degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, with higher spikes on land and at high latitudes
T63	MajorClaim 7066 7137	Human-made climate change is real, and the impacts have already started
T64	Premise 7140 7202	Average temperature is rising rapidly across the United States
T65	Premise 7204 7267	Heat waves are becoming more extreme and will continue to do so
T66	Premise 7270 7363	Overall precipitation has decreased in the South and West and increased in the North and East
T70	Premise 7553 7705	Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said even modest heat from global warming can build up over time
T71	Premise 7709 7870	The accumulated energy over one month is equivalent to a small microwave oven at full power for six minutes over every square foot of the planet,” Trenberth said
