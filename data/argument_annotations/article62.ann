T1	Claim 167 309	The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration
T2	Claim 320 542	the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate
T9	Claim 1268 1483	A rapid disintegration of Antarctica might, in the worst case, cause the sea to rise so fast that tens of millions of coastal refugees would have to flee inland, potentially straining societies to the breaking point
T10	Claim 1485 1575	Climate scientists used to regard that scenario as fit only for Hollywood disaster scripts
T11	Claim 1593 1642	they cannot rule it out with any great confidence
T12	Claim 1645 1761	Yet as they try to determine how serious the situation is, the scientists confront a frustrating lack of information
T13	Claim 1764 1970	Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century
T15	Claim 2080 2169	those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them
T16	Premise 2172 2221	We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow
T17	Premise 2306 2409	There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica
T23	Claim 3257 3337	The Ross shelf helps to slow the flow of land ice from Antarctica into the ocean
T24	Claim 3339 3406	Compared with other parts of Antarctica, the shelf seems stable now
T28	Premise 3977 4160	Remote as Antarctica may seem, every person in the world who gets into a car, eats a steak or boards an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk
T29	Claim 4162 4322	If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough, scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea
T30	Claim 4329 4478	they do not know exactly what the trigger temperature might be, or whether the recent acceleration of the ice means that Earth has already reached it
T32	Claim 4741 4843	The risk is clear: Antarctica’s collapse has the potential to inundate coastal cities across the globe
T35	Claim 5189 5354	If that ice sheet were to disintegrate, it could raise the level of the sea by more than 160 feet — a potential apocalypse, depending on exactly how fast it happened
T36	Claim 5386 5492	if society burns all the fossil fuels known to exist, the collapse of the ice sheet will become inevitable
T37	Claim 5495 5649	Improbable as such a large rise might sound, something similar may have already happened, and recently enough that it is still lodged in collective memory
T38	Premise 5652 5779	In the 19th century, ethnographers realized that virtually every old civilization had some kind of flood myth in its literature
T39	Premise 5782 5874	In the Epic of Gilgamesh, waters so overwhelm the mortals that the gods grow frightened, too
T40	Premise 5876 5960	In India’s version, Lord Vishnu warns a man to take refuge in a boat, carrying seeds
T41	Premise 5962 6040	In the Bible, God orders Noah to carry two of every living creature on his ark
T42	Premise 6043 6190	“I don’t think the biblical deluge is just a fairy tale,” said Terence J. Hughes, a retired University of Maine glaciologist living in South Dakota
T44	Claim 6363 6427	That flooding would have occurred at the end of the last ice age
T47	Premise 6765 6892	Beginning perhaps 25,000 years ago, after the orbit shifted again, the ice sheets began to melt and the sea level began to rise
T48	Premise 6894 6978	Over several thousand years, coastlines receded inland by as much as a hundred miles
T49	Premise 6981 7168	Human civilization did not yet exist, but early societies of hunters and gatherers lived along most of the world’s shorelines, and they would have watched the inundation claim their lands
T52	Claim 7332 7438	Scientists once thought that further destruction of those ice sheets was likely to take thousands of years
T53	Claim 7445 7590	starting in the 1970s, lone scientific voices warned that the ice sheets could be vulnerable much sooner if greenhouse emissions were not checked
T55	Premise 7712 7789	the West Antarctic ice sheet sits in a giant bowl, much of it below sea level
T57	Premise 7822 7987	Extensive satellite monitoring began in the 1990s and, within a decade, evidence emerged that the ice sheet was already starting to speed up, retreat and destabilize
T61	Claim 8454 8604	both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace
T62	Claim 8607 8760	In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century
T63	Claim 8830 8881	they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough
T66	Claim 9101 9258	the world population is seven billion and growing, and hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars of property are within a few feet of sea level
T67	Claim 9261 9407	If the rise turns out to be as rapid as the worst-case projections, it could lead to a catastrophe without parallel in the history of civilization
T70	Premise 9818 9883	as the ice age ended and the oceans warmed, all of them collapsed
T71	Claim 9885 10111	These experts have started to think that West Antarctica, as a fragile holdover, is basically a disaster waiting to happen — and that if human-caused global warming has not already set the calamity in motion, it may soon do so
T81	Claim 11476 11528	The answers carry profound implications for humanity
T82	Premise 11530 11707	In the scientists’ worst-case computer simulations, continued global warming will cause the Ross Ice Shelf to weaken and collapse starting as early as the middle of this century
T85	Claim 11984 12216	The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer
T86	Claim 12218 12306	They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century
T87	Claim 12309 12590	Whether these alarming forecasts ultimately prove right depends in part on the shape of the sea floor beneath the ice shelf, and in particular on whether it has deep channels that can funnel warming ocean water under the ice shelf and attack the West Antarctic ice sheet from below
T88	Premise 12592 12745	A different undersea topography — high ridges of rock, for example — may keep warmer water out, stabilizing the ice sheet, possibly for hundreds of years
T96	Claim 13842 13869	Satellite evidence suggests
T99	Claim 14139 14277	But the story is not straightforward, and the warmer water attacking the ice has not been linked to global warming — at least not directly
T100	Claim 14279 14440	The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries
T101	Claim 14505 14529	Some scientists think so
T103	Premise 14568 14780	“We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica
T114	Premise 16395 16553	About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades
T115	Premise 16556 16815	The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked
T116	Claim 16822 16891	some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable
T117	Premise 16893 17185	In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals
T118	Claim 17188 17297	Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable
T119	Premise 17300 17356	“There’s still a chance that all hell will break loose,”
T120	Premise 17375 17478	“But the model is suggesting there’s a way to reduce the risk of a big sea-level rise from Antarctica.”
