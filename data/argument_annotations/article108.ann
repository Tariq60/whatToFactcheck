T1	MajorClaim 118 375	A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned
T2	Claim 378 503	This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes
T3	Claim 631 912	The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature
T4	Premise 925 1080	that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs
T11	Claim 1825 2016	The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life
T12	Premise 2019 2258	Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level
T13	Premise 2262 2550	We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions
T19	Premise 3196 3210	Rockström says
T21	Premise 3298 3449	Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state
T25	Premise 3947 4047	The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century
T27	Premise 4109 4220	“The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said
T30	Claim 4371 4510	Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory
T31	Premise 4512 4620	“It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute
T40	Premise 5285 5419	In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight
T41	Premise 5526 5574	we need to be much more proactive in that regard
