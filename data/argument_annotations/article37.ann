T3	Premise 284 480	It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater
T4	Claim 609 659	it was too late for ethical consumption to save us
T8	Premise 913 1158	His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer
T18	Claim 2039 2112	What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change
T24	Premise 2472 2513	The computer models just weren’t reliable
T28	Claim 2799 2862	There are various possible explanations for his change of heart
T29	Claim 2864 2893	One is that Lovelock is right
T30	Claim 2974 3045	Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible
T33	Premise 3424 3565	All things being equal – “and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board”
T34	Claim 3568 3741	he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race
T74	MajorClaim 7114 7245	Because quite soon – before we’ve reached the end of this century, even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over
T82	Premise 7487 7600	Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity
T83	Premise 7602 7700	Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, among others, have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks
T86	Premise 7828 7886	“We’re already happily letting computers design themselves
T88	Claim 8129 8186	Computers will develop independent volition and intuition
T98	Claim 8675 8758	Lovelock doesn’t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over

T101	Premise 9037 9057	I ask him to explain
T107	Claim 9465 9577	It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue
T114	Claim 9801 9848	The implications for climate change are obvious
T118	Premise 10096 10152	“They won’t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature,
T119	Premise 10250 10368	They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them
T130	Claim 11048 11111	whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence
T142	Claim 11661 11785	Lovelock was no less bafflingly cheerful when he believed climate change was about to wipe out 80% of the world’s population
