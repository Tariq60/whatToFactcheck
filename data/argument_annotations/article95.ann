T2	Claim 442 563	Scientists obviously weren’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions, but it was better than the alternative: methane
T5	MajorClaim 733 813	methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws
T6	Premise 839 965	in waterlogged wetland soils, where oxygen is not prevalent, tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane
T8	Premise 1405 1464	Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment
T9	Claim 1709 1777	other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long
T12	Premise 2183 2229	So much methane was produced in the experiment
T14	Claim 2439 2590	This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century
T15	Claim 2768 2807	drier soils would be the bigger problem
T16	Claim 2811 2953	In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century
T17	Claim 3117 3162	The new study would appear to contradict this
T18	Claim 3193 3342	more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades
T21	Claim 3726 3939	The research, she said, could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas
T23	Claim 4168 4423	the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it, which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won’t change in light of the new research
T26	Claim 4776 4988	Róisín Commane, a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research, was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane
T27	Claim 5039 5124	the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors
T28	Premise 5126 5230	The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide
