T1	MajorClaim 129 233	Much of recent global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists to make it look more frightening
T2	Premise 255 551	The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets (GAST) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented
T3	Premise 554 678	What they found is that these readings are “totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data

T10	Premise 1552 1628	Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming
T13	MajorClaim 1971 2041	they all use the same corrupted global average temperature (GAST) data
