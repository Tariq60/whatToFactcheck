T2	Premise 166 333	I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact
T6	Claim 531 641	It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation
T11	Claim 1197 1361	Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound
T14	Premise 1408 1483	CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one
T19	Claim 2023 2169	There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop
T20	Claim 2172 2216	But that theory so far is mostly speculative
T22	Claim 2350 2532	It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete
T23	Claim 2535 2581	Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex
T24	Premise 2583 2673	It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one
T29	Premise 3180 3644	The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade
T30	Claim 3646 3795	A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision
