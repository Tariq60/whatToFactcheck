T3	MajorClaim 457 516	After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole
T5	Premise 656 696	a record low for the third straight year
T7	Claim 844 1082	“This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we’ve been seeing,” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-backed research agency in Boulder, Colo
T8	MajorClaim 1084 1142	“We’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all
T9	Claim 1146 1364	Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that
T10	Claim 1417 1464	but loss of ice coverage can disrupt ecosystems
T11	Premise 1479 1595	it can affect the timing of blooms of phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain
T12	Premise 1598 1691	Less ice coverage also means that there is more dark ocean to absorb more of the sun’s energy
T14	Premise 1782 1916	The data center said on Wednesday that sea ice in the Arctic had reached maximum extent, of about 5.5 million square miles, on March 7
T15	Premise 1918 2048	That is an area nearly twice the size of Australia, but about 470,000 square miles less than the average maximum from 1981 to 2010
T16	Claim 2051 2200	Much of the ice also appears to be thinner than normal, Dr. Serreze said, another result of the unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic this winter
T17	Premise 2219 2390	parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages, and at the pole itself, mean temperatures for November were 23 degrees above normal
T18	Premise 2392 2455	There were similar temperature spikes in December and this year
T19	Premise 2459 2564	The Arctic Ocean was extremely warm over the winter, and there was a very impressive series of heat waves
T21	Claim 2631 2754	Less coverage and thinner ice mean that this summer’s minimum, which is expected to occur in September, is likely to be low
T22	Claim 2756 2853	But there is no direct link between the maximum in March and the minimum after the melting season
T23	Premise 2968 3074	Just because it’s a record low maximum, there’s no prediction it will be a record low minimum in September
T24	Premise 3094 3219	But while a lot can happen in the summer, when you start out at such a low level, you’re not going to get a very high minimum
T25	Premise 3223 3408	Dr. Meier said that in addition to the low overall ice extent, some parts of the Arctic were almost completely devoid of ice this winter, including the Barents Sea off Norway and Russia
