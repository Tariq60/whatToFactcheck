T1	MajorClaim 115 267	The earth is 15 years from a period of low solar activity similar to that last seen during the "mini ice-age" of the 17th century, when the Thames froze
T2	Premise 270 431	Solar researchers at the University of Northumbria have created a new model of the sun's activity which they claim produces "unprecedentedly accurate predictions
T3	Premise 435 562	They said fluid movements within the sun, which are thought to create 11-year cycles in the weather, will converge in the 2030s
T4	Premise 565 662	Solar activity will fall by 60 per cent as two waves of fluid "effectively cancel each other out"
T5	Premise 762 910	In the cycle between 2030 and around 2040] the two waves exactly mirror each other – peaking at the same time but in opposite hemispheres of the sun
T6	Premise 925 1000	Their interaction will be disruptive, or they will nearly cancel each other
T7	Claim 1004 1075	We predict that this will lead to the properties of a ‘Maunder minimum'
T8	Premise 1079 1244	Maunder minimum, indicating low sunspot activity, was the name given to the period between 1645 and 1715, when Europe and North America experienced very cold winters
T11	Claim 1608 1655	her research appeared to have uncovered another
T12	Premise 1659 1770	We found magnetic wave components appearing in pairs, originating in two different layers in the sun’s interior
T16	Premise 1982 2111	"They both have a frequency of approximately 11 years, although this frequency is slightly different, and they are offset in time
T17	Premise 2115 2207	Over the cycle, the waves fluctuate between the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun
T18	Premise 2209 2358	Combining both waves together and comparing to real data for the current solar cycle, we found that our predictions showed an accuracy of 97 per cent
T19	Premise 2362 2499	Effectively, when the waves are approximately in phase, they can show strong interaction, or resonance, and we have strong solar activity
T21	Premise 2555 2666	When there is full phase separation, we have the conditions last seen during the Maunder minimum, 370 years ago
