T6	Premise 639 727	The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica
T8	Premise 813 988	Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet
T9	Claim 990 1125	For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today
T11	Claim 1302 1314	The bad news
T13	Premise 1512 1655	The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs
T22	Premise 2610 2732	Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels
T24	Premise 2807 2866	Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome
T25	Premise 2868 2949	When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas
T28	Premise 3099 3321	Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges
T29	Claim 3324 3425	Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped
T30	Claim 3428 3504	A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe
T32	Premise 3589 3763	All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees
T33	Claim 3766 3855	All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt
T39	Premise 4612 4757	Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings
T41	Claim 4985 5026	Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad
T45	Premise 5309 5511	At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map
T46	Premise 5514 5619	At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater
T51	Premise 6178 6299	Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur
T52	Claim 6301 6521	But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path — meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions
T53	Premise 6524 6639	Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years
T54	Claim 6642 6797	Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode
T57	Premise 7030 7123	Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates
T59	Claim 7174 7497	The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in
T60	Premise 7609 7807	evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age
T65	Premise 8376 8675	recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too
T66	Premise 8678 8909	“If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge
T67	Claim 8912 9014	This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century
T70	Claim 9160 9221	other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable
T72	Claim 9325 9453	Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself
T76	Premise 9809 9876	But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened
T77	Premise 9880 10035	There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat
T79	Premise 10115 10200	Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once
T81	Claim 10361 10538	Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise
T82	Premise 10540 10659	In 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier
T84	Premise 10759 10868	Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,
T85	Claim 10891 11005	Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get
T87	Premise 11133 11243	He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding
