T1	Claim 102 161	This wasn’t supposed to be a bad year for Western wildfires
T5	Premise 422 463	California’s drought ended in the washout
T6	Claim 470 506	fires are now raging across the West
T7	Premise 508 583	More than two dozen named fires currently burn across Washington and Oregon
T8	Premise 585 635	More than one million acres have burned in Montana
T9	Premise 734 785	the largest brushfire in the history of Los Angeles
T16	Claim 1834 1934	The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect recipe for drying out fuels
T18	Claim 2347 2421	This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires
T19	Premise 2489 2572	fire and aridity, which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship
T21	MajorClaim 2683 2896	thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change
T26	Claim 3294 3348	global warming is already having an effect on wildfire
T27	Premise 3472 3617	the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming
T28	Premise 3621 3759	The added forest fire area—due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming—equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined
T29	Claim 3781 3834	Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions
T30	Premise 3887 4053	large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons
T31	Premise 4056 4164	The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt
T33	Claim 4331 4396	Fires have not only been increasing in size due to climate change
T34	Premise 4398 4537	In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible
T35	Premise 4539 4685	This has caused denser and more fire-prone forests than the long-term average for the West, which has led to more massive and uncontrollable fires
T36	Claim 4688 4744	People have also lengthened the season by starting fires
T37	Premise 4847 4972	In a human-free environment, fires could only start after a lightning strike, which only follow from summertime thunderstorms
T41	Claim 5272 5320	in the meantime, the planet will only get hotter
T42	Premise 5324 5470	According to climate models, by the end of this century, the western United States is still projected to warm by about another 3.5 degrees Celsius
