T1	Claim 137 342	2015 was the hottest year in the historical record by far, breaking a mark set only the year before — a burst of heat that has continued into the new year and is roiling weather patterns all over the world
T3	Premise 516 613	One result has been a wave of unusual winter floods coursing down the Mississippi River watershed
T4	Claim 616 684	Scientists started predicting a global temperature record months ago
T6	MajorClaim 850 994	the bulk of the record-setting heat, they say, is a consequence of the long-term planetary warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases
T8	Claim 1146 1195	It will take a few more years to know for certain
T10	Claim 1403 1657	Politicians attempting to claim that greenhouse gases are not a problem seized on that slow period to argue that “global warming stopped in 1998,” with these claims and similar statements reappearing recently on the Republican presidential campaign trail
T11	Claim 1660 1800	Statistical analysis suggested all along that the claims were false, and that the slowdown was, at most, a minor blip in an inexorable trend
T13	Claim 2079 2162	“The answer is no. That was true before last year, but it’s much more obvious now.”
T14	Premise 2251 2404	if the global climate were not warming, the odds of setting two back-to-back record years would be remote, about one chance in every 1,500 pairs of years
T15	Premise 2406 2502	Given the reality that the planet is warming, the odds become far higher, about one chance in 10
T18	Claim 2923 3031	The agencies follow slightly different methods to cope with problems in the data, but obtain similar results
T19	Premise 3034 3178	The American agencies released figures on Wednesday showing that 2015 was the warmest year in a global record that began, in their data, in 1880
T20	Premise 3180 3270	British scientists released figures showing 2015 as the warmest in a record dating to 1850
T21	Premise 3272 3407	The Japan Meteorological Agency had already released preliminary results showing 2015 as the warmest year in a record beginning in 1891
T22	Claim 3410 3526	On Jan. 7, NOAA reported that 2015 was the second-warmest year on record, after 2012, for the lower 48 United States
T23	Claim 3528 3597	That land mass covers less than 2 percent of the surface of the Earth
T25	Claim 3720 3786	The end of the year was especially remarkable in the United States
T27	Claim 3911 4108	A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, and an intensification of rainstorms was one of the fundamental predictions made by climate scientists decades ago as a consequence of human emissions
T28	Premise 4110 4251	That prediction has come to pass, with the rains growing more intense across every region of the United States, but especially so in the East
T30	Claim 4427 4611	Some additional measurements, of shorter duration, are available for the ocean depths and the atmosphere above the surface, both generally showing an inexorable long-term warming trend
T31	Premise 4614 4767	Most satellite measurements of the lower and middle layers of the atmosphere show 2015 to have been the third- or fourth-warmest year in a 37-year record
T33	Claim 4880 4925	They added that this could yet happen in 2016
T35	Premise 5055 5172	In the NOAA data set, 2015 was 0.29 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2014, the largest jump ever over a previous record
T36	Claim 5174 5271	NASA calculated a slightly smaller figure, but still described it as an unusual one-year increase
T37	Claim 5274 5454	The intense warmth of 2015 contributed to a heat wave in India last spring that turns out to have been the second-worst in that country’s history, killing an estimated 2,500 people
T38	Claim 5456 5534	The long-term global warming trend has exacted a severe toll from extreme heat
T40	Premise 5609 5930	Only rough estimates of heat deaths are available, but according to figures from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, in Brussels, the toll over the past two decades is approaching 140,000 people, with most of those deaths occurring during a European heat wave in 2003 and a Russian heat wave in 2010
T41	Claim 5933 6064	The strong El Niño has continued into 2016, raising the possibility that this year will, yet again, set a global temperature record
T42	Claim 6066 6265	The El Niño pattern is also disturbing the circulation of the atmosphere, contributing to worldwide weather extremes that include a drought in southern Africa, threatening the food supply of millions
