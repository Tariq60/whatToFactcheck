T12	Claim 543 571	And Russia is gaining ground
T13	MajorClaim 574 804	The story of the Arctic begins with temperature but it’s so much more—this is a tale about oil and economics, about humanity and science, about politics and borders and the emerging risk of an emboldened and growing Russian empire
T14	Claim 807 973	Arctic glaciers, such as this one in Russia’s Novaya Zemlya archipelago, have captured the attention of scientists who are trying to understand how they melt and flow
T15	Premise 1014 1107	The world as a whole has warmed about 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880

T17	Premise 1187 1328	The most recent year analyzed, October 2015 to September 2016, was 3.5C warmer than the early 1900s, according to the 2016 Arctic Report Card
T19	Premise 1449 1554	Scientists refer to these dramatic physical changes as “Arctic amplification,” or positive feedback loops
T20	Claim 1556 1596	It’s a little bit like compound interest
T21	Premise 1598 1688	A small change snowballs, and Arctic conditions become much less Arctic, much more quickly
T22	Premise 1692 1762	After studying the Arctic and its climate for three-and-a-half decades
T24	Claim 1940 1994	The heat is making quick work of its natural prey: ice
T25	Premise 1997 2140	Scientists track the number of “freezing-degree days,” a running seasonal tally of the amount of time it’s been cold enough for water to freeze
T26	Premise 2142 2260	The 2016-2017 winter season has seen a dramatic shortfall in coldness—more than 20 percent below the average, a record
T29	MajorClaim 2531 2612	Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated
T30	Premise 2614 2689	Last month set a new low for March, out-melting 2015 by 23,000 square miles
T31	Premise 2692 2820	Compared with the 1981-2010 baseline, the average September sea-ice minimum has been dropping by more than 13 percent per decade
T32	Premise 2943 2990	while the rest occurs because of human activity
T33	Premise 2993 3113	Receding ice decreases the Earth’s overall reflectivity, making the Arctic darker and therefore absorbing even more heat
T34	Claim 3116 3206	The ice is not all the same age or thickness, although it has become somewhat more uniform
T35	Premise 3208 3299	In 1985, about 45 percent of Arctic sea ice was made up of older and thicker multi-year ice
T36	Premise 3301 3342	By 2016, that number shrank to 22 percent
T37	Claim 3345 3545	With a greater percentage of seasonal ice, which disappears each Arctic summer, nations of the north have more time and opportunity to explore the resources beneath and within their territorial waters
T38	Claim 3548 3599	The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin’s gain
T39	Claim 3601 3778	Already the largest country on the planet, Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves, and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic
T40	Premise 3810 3856	which makes up more than half the Arctic total
T41	Premise 4051 4190	That dynamic helps bring the Northern Sea Route—shippers’ hoped-for Russian express between Western Europe and East Asia—closer to fruition
T42	Premise 4217 4291	Alaska has warmed about 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the last several decades
T44	Premise 4415 4527	Sea ice, by definition, is already in the water and therefore doesn't add to rising ocean levels as it dissolves
T45	Premise 4529 4605	The same logic does not apply to Greenland’s melting glaciers and ice sheets
T46	Premise 4607 4665	Last year, Greenland saw the second-largest melt on record
T47	Premise 4667 4771	The hot season lasted a troubling 30 to 40 days longer than usual in the northeast portion of the region
T48	Premise 4774 4864	There's enough water locked up in Greenland’s ice sheet to raise seas worldwide by 20 feet
T49	Claim 4866 5030	While it may take centuries to fully melt, scientists are concerned that we have a limited time to act to prevent the climate from locking in the ice sheet’s demise
T50	Claim 5034 5087	Life in the Arctic is changing along with the climate
T51	Premise 5090 5129	Green ice” has appeared in recent years
T52	Premise 5131 5244	Named for its distinctive hue, this ice is so thin that sunlight shines through, allowing phytoplankton to thrive
T53	Premise 5246 5374	Vegetation growth in parts of Canadian and Russian Arctic waters has boomed to from 5 and 19 percent above the 2003-2015 average
T54	Claim 5395 5504	What the change means for delicate ecosystems and fish stocks is the subject of increasing research attention
T55	Claim 5770 5906	“Canada, Russia and parts of the U.S. seem to be the Arctic nations subject to the largest, let’s say, set of diverse regime-shift risks
T56	Claim 5910 6042	In the long run, every part of the Arctic food web may have to adjust to the warming atmosphere’s byproduct: altered ocean chemistry
T57	Claim 6045 6121	Oceans do humanity a huge favor by absorbing some atmospheric carbon dioxide
T58	Premise 6132 6287	when CO2 dissolves into water, it becomes a weak acid that, as it accumulates, may strain ecosystems that have evolved for today’s slightly alkaline waters
T59	Premise 6289 6379	The change is happening globally, but cold water “acidifies” more quickly than warmer seas
T60	Premise 6382 6445	Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere
T61	Claim 6601 6684	scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in
T62	Claim 6717 6804	Perhaps the most visually dramatic change in the landscape has been occurring in Russia
T63	Premise 6806 6889	Warming temperatures have accelerated the rate of natural underground methane leaks
T64	Premise 6891 6952	The gas builds up in the soil, forming mounds called “pingoes
T65	Premise 6955 7048	When the pressure becomes too great, the ground explodes, leaving 30 to 40-meter-wide craters
T66	Premise 7051 7173	Seismologists have begun to install sensors in the Russian Arctic to give advance notice of fields ready to blow their top
T67	Claim 7175 7284	These local events are a powerful visual example of how the world is changing in dramatic and surprising ways
T70	Claim 7498 7644	Many scientists who study the Arctic say that there’s simply no way such dramatic change at the top of the world can avoid affecting life below it
