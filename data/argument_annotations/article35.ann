T3	MajorClaim 686 766	The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought
T4	Claim 961 1094	if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities
T7	Premise 1366 1433	As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards
T8	Premise 1559 1627	Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year
T9	Premise 1629 1746	This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures
T10	Premise 1749 1963	The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland’s volcanoes
T11	Premise 1966 2188	The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today
T12	Claim 2191 2372	This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change
T15	Premise 2823 3040	Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: “One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend
T20	Premise 3689 3793	This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss
T26	Premise 4720 4895	In April, very high temperatures led to a record-breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland, while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice
