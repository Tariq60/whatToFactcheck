T1	MajorClaim 199 301	the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions
T3	Premise 462 579	The roughly three-decade greening trend itself is apparent, the study notes, in satellite images of “leaf area index”
T6	Premise 1592 1747	the greenhouse-gas filled computer simulations looked much more like the satellite observations than did simulations that only included natural variability
T7	Claim 1785 2002	the trend of strengthened northern vegetation greening … can be rigorously attributed, with high statistical confidence, to anthropogenic forcings, particularly to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
T8	Claim 2069 2221	the report is at least the third study in the past several months alone to highlight northern hemisphere greening and to reinforce this basic conclusion
T9	Claim 2335 2366	global warming won’t be all bad
T13	Claim 3059 3181	Another factor enhancing plant growth, meanwhile, seems to be more human-induced falling of nitrogen out of the atmosphere
T16	Claim 3443 3509	the current satellite-based approach represents a blunt instrument
T17	Premise 3511 3631	An examination of total leaf area, he notes, doesn’t record whether a particular area has changed its type of vegetation
T18	Premise 3708 3810	the science is less clear about what is happening in the global tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere
T20	Claim 3945 4099	a key fraction of all the greenhouse gases that humans pour into the atmosphere each year is pulled back into plants through the process of photosynthesis
T21	Claim 4101 4254	This is happening even as the overall warming of the planet may, by lengthening growing seasons and moistening the atmosphere, further stoke plant growth
T22	Claim 4313 4434	The key question then becomes how much this process can offset overall global warming over time. And that’s quite unclear
T23	Premise 4437 4487	There’s a lot, after all, that we don’t understand
T24	Premise 4503 4710	a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report found that while Arctic tundras have indeed been greening over the past 30 years, in the past two to four years, that trend has reversed itself
T29	Claim 5058 5155	the trend is already prompting more optimistic assessments of our climate future in some quarters
T30	Premise 5290 5441	despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost, might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century
T31	Claim 5468 5588	greening is emerging as a factor with the potential to blunt some of the worst impacts of human greenhouse gas emissions
T32	Claim 5604 5715	researchers do not seem to be arguing that it’s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend
T33	Claim 5719 5918	While we are perhaps lucky that CO2 has this effect on plant physiology, in addition to being a greenhouse gas, it is not our ‘get out of jail free’ card when it comes to our ongoing emissions of CO2
