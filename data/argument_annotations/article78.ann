T1	MajorClaim 100 216	All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic
T2	Claim 310 356	infant sea creatures will be especially harmed
T3	Claim 374 437	number of baby cod growing to adulthood could fall to a quarter
T6	Claim 800 861	some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes
T8	Claim 996 1137	changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change, pollution, coastal development, over-fishing and agricultural fertilisers
T9	Premise 1140 1290	Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater, it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water
T10	Premise 1458 1584	Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1
T14	Premise 1883 1965	Acidification affects marine life across all groups, although to different degrees
T17	Premise 2188 2334	even if an organism isn't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web
T19	Premise 2459 2731	scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation
T21	Claim 3027 3154	almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations
T22	Premise 3157 3261	Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod, blue mussels, starfish, sea urchins and sea butterflies
T23	Premise 3264 3344	But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification
T27	Claim 3871 4014	"It's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society
