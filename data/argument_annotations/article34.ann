T4	MajorClaim 715 937	For decades, as the global warming created by human emissions caused land ice to melt and ocean water to expand, scientists warned that the accelerating rise of the sea would eventually imperil the United States’ coastline
T7	Claim 1158 1330	Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called “sunny-day flooding” — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years
T8	Claim 1332 1436	The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly
T11	Claim 1788 1888	In coastal regions, that compounds the damage from the increasingly heavy rains plaguing the country
T12	Claim 1955 2034	Scientists say these rains are also a consequence of human greenhouse emissions
T15	Claim 2328 2405	Local governments, under pressure from annoyed citizens, are beginning to act
T16	Premise 2407 2486	Elections are being won on promises to invest money to protect against flooding
T18	Claim 2680 2724	mayors of both parties are sounding an alarm
T19	Premise 2728 2816	I’m a Republican, but I also realize, by any objective analysis, the sea level is rising
T20	Claim 2954 3009	local leaders say they cannot tackle this problem alone
T21	Premise 3011 3182	They are pleading with state and federal governments for guidance and help, including billions to pay for flood walls, pumps and road improvements that would buy them time
T22	Claim 3189 3229	Congress has largely ignored these pleas
T26	Premise 3639 3825	The federal government spends billions of taxpayer dollars in ways that add to the risks, by subsidizing local governments and homeowners who build in imperiled locations along the coast
T27	Claim 3828 3909	As the problem worsens, experts are warning that national security is on the line
T31	Premise 5786 5832	Because the land is sinking as the ocean rises
T34	Claim 6158 6223	The biggest problems involve frequent flooding of homes and roads
T35	Premise 6225 6355	As the sea rises, hundreds of tidal creeks and marshes that thread through the region are bringing saltwater to people’s doorsteps
T38	Premise 7690 7782	The Obama administration recently gave Virginia more than $100 million to carry the plan out
T39	Claim 7924 8023	the size of that grant illustrates the scope of the problem confronting the region, and the country
T40	Premise 8025 8119	protecting a single neighborhood from rising water can easily cost tens of millions of dollars
T41	Premise 8121 8164	Sea walls and streets may have to be raised

T47	Premise 9178 9336	an effort by the Pentagon to appoint officers to take charge of climate resilience led to a House vote prohibiting taxpayer money from being spent on the plan
T48	Premise 9339 9581	“When we distract our military with a radical climate change agenda, we detract from their main purpose of defending America from enemies” like the Islamic State, said Mr. Buck of Colorado, the Republican congressman who sponsored the measure
T51	Claim 11762 11993	The opponents of climate science in Congress, and the tiny group of climate researchers allied with them, have argued that the concerns of thousands of mainstream scientists about the future are based on unproven computer forecasts
T52	Claim 12050 12100	mounting evidence of what has happened in the past
T53	Claim 12132 12267	it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6,000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels
T60	Premise 13390 13510	The research, likely to take years, may supply a figure for how quickly the ocean was able to rise under past conditions
T62	Premise 13571 13722	The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly, perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth’s history
T65	Claim 13941 14020	recent research suggests the breakup of West Antarctica could occur much faster
T66	Claim 14022 14184	In the worst-case scenario, this research suggests, the rate of sea-level rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century, about 10 times faster than today
T67	Claim 14187 14290	In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100
T77	Claim 15155 15373	Along the East Coast, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that many communities have already, or will soon, pass a threshold where sunny-day flooding starts to happen much more often
T78	Premise 15376 15469	“When you look at the historical record, there’s no trend saying the flooding is going down,”
T79	Premise 15504 15623	The trends are all very clear. They’re going up, and they’re going up in many of these areas in an accelerating fashion
T80	Claim 15715 15803	It is fragile, and might not survive if Donald J. Trump is elected president in November
T82	Premise 15834 15937	But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt
T83	Claim 15942 16051	even if the deal survives, it will, at best, slow the rise of the sea and perhaps limit the ultimate increase
T91	Claim 18672 18699	one likely to cost billions

T14	SuperAnnotatorPremise 6875 7019	There’s just more and more visible impacts: water on the street, water that won’t clear from the ditch, these intense rain events, higher tides,
T17	SuperAnnotatorPremise 7040 7247	It’s beginning to catch the attention of citizens, restaurant owners, business people, politicians. There’s just much more of a conversation, and it’s not just in the politically safe places. It’s everywhere
