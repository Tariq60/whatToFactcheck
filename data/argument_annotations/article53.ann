T1	Claim 152 336	The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has long been one of the world’s most magnificent natural wonders, so enormous it can be seen from space, so beautiful it can move visitors to tears
T2	MajorClaim 343 427	the reef, and the profusion of sea creatures living near it, are in profound trouble
T3	Premise 430 616	Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector, were recently found to be dead, killed last year by overheated seawater
T4	Premise 618 714	More southerly sections around the middle of the reef that barely escaped then are bleaching now
T5	Premise 831 928	We didn’t expect to see this level of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef for another 30 years,
T6	Premise 1173 1274	In the north, I saw hundreds of reefs — literally two-thirds of the reefs were dying and are now dead
T7	Claim 1362 1481	is part of a global calamity that has been unfolding intermittently for nearly two decades and seems to be intensifying
T8	Premise 1483 1656	In the paper, dozens of scientists described the recent disaster as the third worldwide mass bleaching of coral reefs since 1998, but by far the most widespread and damaging
T9	Claim 1659 1727	The state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas
T10	Claim 1729 1816	Their distress and death are yet another marker of the ravages of global climate change
T11	Premise 1819 1901	If most of the world’s coral reefs die, as scientists fear is increasingly likely,
T13	Claim 2013 2053	In poorer countries, lives are at stake:
T15	Claim 2252 2318	reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party
T16	Premise 2321 2491	They warned decades ago that the coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean
T17	Premise 2493 2633	Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs
T18	MajorClaim 2637 2674	Climate change is not a future threat
T19	Premise 2701 2760	On the Great Barrier Reef, it’s been happening for 18 years
T20	Premise 2764 2849	Corals require warm water to thrive, but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat
T21	Premise 2851 2943	Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can sometimes kill the tiny creatures
T22	Premise 2946 3118	Globally, the ocean has warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, by a conservative calculation, and a bit more in the tropics, home to many reefs
T23	Premise 3120 3322	An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880
T24	Claim 3325 3451	It was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die, but now formal scientific assessments are coming in
T25	Premise 3453 3601	The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500-mile section of the reef north of Cairns, a city on Australia’s eastern coast
T26	Premise 3604 3657	Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress
T27	Premise 3726 3961	Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper, documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died, and would not be likely to recover soon, if at all
T28	Premise 3964 3998	Professor Hughes led those surveys
T29	Claim 4000 4156	He said that he and his students cried when he showed them maps of the damage, which he had calculated in part by flying low in small planes and helicopters
T30	Premise 4229 4352	67 percent of the corals had died in a long stretch north of Port Douglas, and in patches, the mortality reached 83 percent
T31	Premise 4355 4606	By luck, a storm stirred the waters in the central and southern parts of the reef at a critical moment, cooling them, and mortality there was much lower — about 6 percent in a stretch off Townsville, and even lower in the southernmost part of the reef
T32	Premise 4703 4779	the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record
T33	Premise 4783 4842	Only 9 percent of the reef has avoided bleaching since 1998
T34	Premise 4961 5049	Water temperatures there remain so high that another round of mass bleaching is underway
T35	Premise 5216 5265	back-to-back bleaching is unheard-of in Australia
T36	Premise 5268 5388	The central and southern part of the reef had already been badly damaged by human activities like dredging and pollution
T37	Claim 5391 5563	The Australian government has tried to combat these local threats with its Reef 2050 plan, restricting port development, dredging and agricultural runoff, among other risks
T38	Premise 5609 5636	given the high temperatures
T40	Premise 5705 5775	The reefs in muddy water were just as fried as those in pristine water
T41	Premise 5801 5924	“That’s not good news in terms of what you can do locally to prevent bleaching — the answer to that is not very much at all
T43	Claim 5973 6131	With the election of Donald J. Trump as the American president, a recent global deal to tackle the problem, known as the Paris Agreement, seems to be in peril
T44	Premise 6235 6311	many scientists and conservationists see as the reef’s most immediate threat
T46	Premise 6464 6529	The fact is, Australia is the largest coal exporter in the world,
T48	Premise 6720 6836	Australia relies on the Great Barrier Reef for about 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue
T51	Claim 7074 7151	The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species
T52	Premise 7153 7316	The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water
T53	Claim 7319 7465	But the changes humans are causing are so rapid, by geological standards, that it is not entirely clear that coral species will be able to keep up
T54	Claim 7467 7579	And even if the corals do survive, that does not mean individual reefs will continue to thrive where they do now
T55	Premise 7582 7615	Coral reefs are sensitive systems
T56	Premise 7643 7788	The corals themselves are tiny polyps that act like farmers, capturing colorful single-celled plants called algae that convert sunlight into food
T57	Premise 7790 7880	The coral polyps form colonies and build a limestone scaffolding on which to live — a reef
T58	Premise 7883 8026	But when the water near a reef gets too hot, the algae begin producing toxins, and the corals expel them in self-defense, turning ghostly white
T59	Premise 8028 8164	If water temperatures drop soon enough, the corals can grow new algae and survive, but if not, they may succumb to starvation or disease
T60	Claim 8167 8222	Even when the corals die, some reefs eventually recover
T61	Premise 8224 8368	If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years
T62	Premise 8371 8489	But the temperature of the ocean is now high enough that global mass bleaching events seem to be growing more frequent
T63	Claim 8491 8600	If they become routine, many of the world’s hard-hit coral reefs may never be able to re-establish themselves
T64	Claim 8603 8784	Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators
T65	Claim 8788 8869	I don’t think the Great Barrier Reef will ever again be as great as it used to be
T67	Premise 9216 9341	water temperatures are high enough that his maps are showing continued hot water across millions of square miles of the ocean
T68	Premise 9470 9539	described it and the more recent findings as accurate, and depressing
T69	Premise 9558 9689	extensive coral devastation last year off Kiritimati Island, part of the Republic of Kiribati several thousand miles from Australia
T70	Premise 9741 9867	With the international effort to fight climate change at risk of losing momentum, “ocean temperatures continue to march upward
T71	MajorClaim 9886 10027	The idea that we’re going to have 20 or 30 years before we reach the next bleaching and mortality event for the corals is basically a fantasy
