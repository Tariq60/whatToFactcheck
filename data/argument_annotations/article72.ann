T4	MajorClaim 597 694	Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet's largest ocean circulation system
T5	Claim 696 812	While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world, we will be largely in uncharted territory
T11	Claim 1533 1717	What's more important, and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes
T12	Premise 1719 1865	The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere, playing a key role in warming of western Europe
T13	Premise 1867 2020	You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC, the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe
T14	Claim 2023 2170	Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation
T15	Claim 2172 2273	Hence, a slowdown in the planet's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes
T16	Claim 2275 2347	The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland
T17	Claim 2349 2457	This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic, inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters
T18	Claim 2459 2567	This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north
T19	Claim 2696 2769	Melting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades
T20	Premise 2771 2871	Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30% less today than it was in 1979
T21	Claim 2873 2963	This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing
T22	Claim 2993 3065	we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system
T23	Premise 3068 3187	This scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie "The Day After Tomorrow."
T24	Claim 3188 3366	As a disclaimer, the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales
T25	Claim 3465 3513	scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead
