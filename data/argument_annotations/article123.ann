T1	MajorClaim 141 459	A landmark report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent
T2	Premise 463 729	The report, issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040
T6	Claim 1164 1427	The authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty
T7	Premise 1429 1690	Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change
T8	Claim 1693 1796	The new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark
T9	Claim 1799 1896	Avoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years,
T11	Claim 1982 2157	But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming, they concede that it may be politically unlikely
T12	Premise 2242 2391	For instance, the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions — perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100 — would be required
T13	Premise 2393 2552	But such a move would be almost politically impossible in the United States, the world’s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China
T14	Premise 2554 2673	Lawmakers around the world, including in China, the European Union and California, have enacted carbon pricing programs
T15	Premise 2676 2850	President Trump, who has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, has vowed to increase the burning of coal and said he intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement
T16	Premise 2852 3053	And on Sunday in Brazil, the world’s seventh-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, voters appeared on track to elect a new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has said he also plans to withdraw from the accord
T19	Premise 3371 3514	But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming
T20	Claim 3603 3758	Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040, and at the lower temperature, the report shows
T21	Premise 3761 3849	It’s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime
T22	Premise 3939 4091	To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, the report said, greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050
T23	Premise 4093 4233	It also found that, by 2050, use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent
T24	Premise 4235 4384	Renewable energy such as wind and solar, which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today, would have to increase to as much as 67 percent
T25	Claim 4388 4488	This report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal,”
T27	Claim 4578 4686	The World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global warming calls for an end of coal use
T28	Premise 4688 4899	In a statement, Katie Warrick, its interim chief executive, noted that forecasts from the International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.
T29	Premise 4902 5010	Ms. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology
T30	Premise 5012 5128	Such technology, which is currently too expensive for commercial use, could allow coal to continue to be widely used
T32	Premise 5344 5532	A State Department statement said that “acceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report
T33	Claim 5536 5585	The State Department delegation faced a conundrum
T34	Claim 5587 5745	Refusing to approve the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage
T35	Claim 5747 5850	However, the delegation also represents a president who has rejected climate science and climate policy
T36	Premise 5854 6038	We reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms that are better for the American people,
T37	Claim 6061 6132	The report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change
T38	Premise 6134 6300	The estimated $54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would grow to $69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and beyond, the report found
T39	Premise 6379 6466	The report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark
T40	Premise 6468 6619	Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8 degrees since about the 1850s, the beginning of large-scale industrial coal burning, the report found
T41	Claim 6622 6737	The United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change
T42	Premise 6739 6888	The report concluded that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming
T43	Claim 6891 6968	The report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions
T44	Premise 6970 7043	“A price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation,” the report concludes
T45	Premise 7045 7218	It estimates that to be effective, such a price would have to range from $135 to $5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, and from $690 to $27,000 per ton by 2100
T46	Premise 7221 7372	By comparison, under the Obama administration, government economists estimated that an appropriate price on carbon would be in the range of $50 per ton
T47	Premise 7374 7449	Under the Trump administration, that figure was lowered to about $7 per ton
T48	Premise 7452 7646	Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, has made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon tax
T49	Premise 7650 7735	Carbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas prices and electric rates
T50	Claim 7970 8079	The report details the economic damage expected should governments fail to enact policies to reduce emissions
T51	Premise 8081 8198	The United States, it said, could lose roughly 1.2 percent of gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warming
T52	Premise 8201 8466	In addition, it said, the United States along with Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are home to 50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased coastal flooding by 2040, if 2.7 degrees of warming occur
T53	Premise 8469 8582	At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a “disproportionately rapid evacuation” of people from the tropics
T55	Premise 8758 8858	You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million
T56	Claim 8862 9222	The report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold
T57	Claim 9225 9276	In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible
T58	Premise 9296 9321	All coral reefs would die
T59	Premise 9323 9433	However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off
T60	Claim 9437 9530	For governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive
T62	Claim 9609 9642	But it has a lot of disadvantages
