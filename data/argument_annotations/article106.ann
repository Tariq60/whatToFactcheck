T2	Claim 214 332	yellow-bellied marmots are getting fatter and bigger because of the longer growing season brought on by climate change
T5	Claim 551 653	There's a cycle that starts when the snow melts and the earth thaws high in Colorado's Rocky Mountains
T6	Premise 655 779	It's a seasonal cycle based on timing and temperature, two variables that climate change is pushing increasingly out of sync
T7	Claim 782 820	To the outsider, it can be hard to see
T10	Claim 1037 1110	But those who know this ecosystem will tell you something is a little off
T11	Premise 1112 1144	The flowers are blooming earlier
T12	Premise 1146 1181	The marmots are mating in early May
T13	Premise 1183 1282	Spring is springing sooner across the Northern Hemisphere, changing natural cycles around the world
T14	Premise 1296 1380	brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier
T15	Premise 1398 1471	birds are nesting and breeding a week earlier than they did a century ago
T16	Claim 1475 1607	One of the consequences of climate change is that even though everything is happening earlier, they're not changing at the same rate
T18	Premise 1761 1891	Ecologist David Inouye says he has counted nearly 5 million flowers in the meadows around the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory
T20	Claim 1959 1997	The results can be seen all around him
T21	Premise 1999 2059	Flowers are blooming before there are bees to pollinate them
T22	Premise 2061 2174	Hard frosts are still occurring long after winter's snow melts away, decimating fruit orchards and budding plants
T23	Premise 2176 2208	Allergy season is getting longer
T24	Claim 2211 2434	Inouye says that when he started spending his summers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colo., cataloging flowers in the thin mountain air, climate change wasn't really a thing people were talking about
T25	Claim 2457 2505	the evidence of it started to become unavoidable
T26	Premise 2509 2545	Temperatures are getting warmer here
T27	Premise 2562 2652	April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be
T28	Premise 2656 2739	Some plants and wildlife, taking their thermal cue, have been able to adapt in kind
T29	Premise 2741 2758	Some are thriving
T30	Premise 2760 2788	Others are being left behind
T31	Premise 2791 2848	Slivers of snow still hide in coulees near Schofield Pass
T32	Premise 2850 2979	A low winter snowpack and high spring temperatures melted most of winter's snow earlier than normal in Colorado's Rocky Mountains
T33	Premise 3018 3095	Colorado's snowpack this year was the worst it had been in more than 30 years
T34	Premise 3097 3132	Temperatures in early spring soared
T35	Claim 3135 3197	Many researchers here view this as a glimpse of things to come
T36	Claim 3201 3245	You can see it visually," says Rebecca Irwin
T37	Premise 3299 3319	We have less flowers
T38	Premise 3323 3429	Fewer flowers means less food for the native bees that buzz around in meadows like the one Irwin stands in
T39	Premise 3432 3531	She and two others are equipped with wispy butterfly nets and fanny packs filled with plastic vials
T40	Premise 3534 3682	They're hoping to get an idea of how different bees are doing in this environment by catching as many of them as they can over the course of an hour
T44	Premise 3958 4045	it's clear that they caught far fewer worker bees than they would have in a normal year
T45	Premise 4128 4152	there's no food for them
T46	Premise 4168 4212	Some bees, Irwin says, seem to be doing fine
T47	Premise 4214 4288	In years like this, they're able to emerge earlier to meet the early bloom
T48	Premise 4292 4362	But some of them are constrained by how long it takes them to develop,
T55	Premise 4920 5051	The ability of a species to adapt to its circumstances — to roll with the environmental punches, so to speak — is called plasticity
T56	Premise 5054 5114	Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists
T58	Claim 5157 5268	Species with less plasticity, those that depend on a specific ecosystem or climate, are more likely to struggle
T61	Claim 5578 5631	"Marmots are all about getting obese," Blumstein says
T62	Premise 5633 5725	"They adjust their annual schedule appropriately to be active when the vegetation is growing
T63	Premise 5729 5949	Marmot researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory try to capture and tag every yellow-bellied marmot in their research area to know how individuals and populations are impacted by changing climate conditions
T64	Premise 5954 6040	An earlier spring means a longer growing season, so they have more time to gather food
T65	Premise 6071 6104	marmots seem to be getting bigger
T66	Claim 6106 6265	He stops short of calling them a "climate change winner" though, noting that a longer growing season also means more chances for them to be killed by predators
T67	Claim 6268 6431	Other species are emerging as winners though, including "some that people might not be very fond of," says Jill Anderson, a geneticist at the University of Georgia
T68	Premise 6434 6530	She points to poison ivy, which is expected to thrive with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
T69	Premise 6533 6660	Researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory also report seeing far more ticks this summer than in any previous year
T72	Claim 6773 6852	And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity,
T76	Claim 7133 7292	Just off a ridge, in a verdant meadow, John Harte, an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley, has created a window into the future of this place
T77	Claim 7294 7309	It's a grim one
T82	Premise 7742 7862	Ecologist John Harte overlooks his nearly 30-year experiment simulating the expected conditions in these meadows by 2050
T83	Premise 7864 7990	Tangles of sagebrush grow under lines of heat lamps, pushing out some of the flowers and plants that normally cover the ground
T84	Premise 7996 8065	That's comparable to the climate we expect by the year 2050," he says
T85	Claim 8068 8182	The heat lamps have been on since then, day and night, and the change that is occurring beneath them is remarkable
T86	Premise 8185 8260	The yellow and purple flowers that dot the landscape nearby are mostly gone
T87	Premise 8262 8354	In their place is sagebrush, a prolific plant that you would usually see at lower elevations
T88	Premise 8358 8473	We are projecting that all of these meadows are going to look like that," Harte says, pointing to the gnarled plant
T89	Claim 8475 8506	"We are homogenizing the planet
T90	Claim 8510 8548	There's another concern, just as great
T91	Premise 8550 8651	Harte and his colleagues have found that the heated soil holds far less carbon than the native ground
T92	Premise 8653 8795	That missing carbon, he says, is going into the air, creating the potential for a feedback process that will accelerate climate change further
T93	MajorClaim 8799 8869	Ecosystems affect climate just as much as climate affects ecosystems,"
T94	Claim 8879 8908	"And the changes happen quick
