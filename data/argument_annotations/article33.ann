T1	Premise 106 227	Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic, making more than 50 trips there, some in submarines under the polar ice
T2	Claim 229 380	He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink
T3	Premise 382 512	He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001
T4	Premise 514 716	His book, A Farewell to Ice, tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate
T6	Claim 827 836	It hasn’t
T8	Claim 862 864	No
T9	Premise 866 918	There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover
T10	Premise 920 1000	However, each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away
T11	Premise 1002 1058	The overall trend is a very strong downward one, however
T12	Claim 1060 1147	Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover
T13	Claim 1149 1278	Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free
T14	Claim 1280 1333	You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship
T15	Premise 1335 1542	There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline
T16	MajorClaim 1614 1671	think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018
T18	Claim 1748 1854	People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change
T19	Claim 1856 1879	Things happen, they say
T20	Claim 1890 1969	the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population
T21	Claim 1975 2009	key effect will be albedo feedback
T22	Premise 2011 2088	Sea ice reflects about 50% of the solar radiation it receives back into space
T23	Premise 2090 2130	By contrast, water reflects less than 10
T24	Premise 2133 2308	So if you replace ice with water, which is darker, much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present
T25	Claim 2311 2358	Sea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system
T26	Premise 2360 2522	Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further
T27	Claim 2524 2627	These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions
T29	Claim 2702 2779	The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt
T30	Premise 2781 2842	It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year
T31	Claim 2844 2884	Antarctica is adding to the melt as well
T32	Claim 2886 2929	Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result
T33	Premise 2931 3073	The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century
T34	Claim 3075 3129	I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely
T35	Claim 3131 3178	Indeed, it is probably the best we can hope for
T36	Claim 3210 3235	it is really very serious
T37	Claim 3237 3313	It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world
T38	Premise 3315 3438	We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh, it just means more and more people will be drowned
T41	Claim 3623 3635	No it is not
T42	Claim 3637 3670	We also have the issue of methane
T43	Premise 3672 3809	Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed
T44	Premise 3811 3931	The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic icecaps
T45	Premise 3934 4005	Until around 2005, even in summer, you still had sea ice near the coast
T46	Premise 4007 4035	Then it started to disappear
T47	Claim 4196 4246	It has started to melt with dangerous consequences
T48	Premise 4248 4318	Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates
T49	Premise 4320 4433	When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution
T51	Claim 4503 4564	Yes, we can measure methane over large areas using satellites
T52	Premise 4566 4699	These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating
T53	Premise 4742 4869	There is a scientist called Jason Box who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon’s breath
T54	Claim 4871 4936	They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments
T55	Premise 4938 4997	They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes
T57	Claim 5083 5111	It is 23 times more powerful
T58	Claim 5113 5178	However, methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide
T59	Premise 5180 5269	It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years
T60	Premise 5271 5442	By contrast, carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100 years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed
T62	Premise 5486 5598	Today, there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere
T63	Claim 5601 5694	So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating
T65	Premise 5829 5878	But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect
T66	Premise 5880 5970	All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere
T67	Premise 5972 6028	We are having to live with last century’s carbon dioxide
T68	Claim 6056 6120	there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide
T71	Claim 6280 6385	the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there
T72	Premise 6419 6484	we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air
T73	Claim 6486 6540	The trouble is that they don’t just how we can do that
T74	Claim 6542 6628	The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS: bio-energy with carbon capture and storage
T75	Premise 6630 6696	Essentially, you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground
T76	Premise 6698 6749	These grow, absorbing carbon dioxide in the process
T77	Premise 6751 6868	Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping, liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released
T80	Claim 6912 6952	I am a bit suspicious of this technology
T81	Premise 6954 6998	BECCS will need so much land to be effective
T82	Premise 7000 7120	Calculations suggest it would need 40% to 50% of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need
T84	MajorClaim 7262 7391	Other techniques, such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, on beaches, will simply not scale up
T85	Claim 7393 7502	They won’t work, so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly
T86	Claim 7505 7677	As far as I can see, it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end
T87	Claim 7679 7752	It can be done, I am sure, but at the moment we do not have such a device
T88	Claim 7754 7888	However, without something like that I cannot see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere
T89	Claim 7890 7966	We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed
T91	Claim 8025 8131	I think humanity can do it, but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology
