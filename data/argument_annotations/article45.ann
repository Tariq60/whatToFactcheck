T1	Claim 131 275	There was a breathtakingly beautiful BBC series on the Great Barrier Reef recently which my son pronounced himself almost too depressed to watch
T2	Premise 277 305	‘What’s the point?’ said Boy
T3	Premise 307 389	‘By the time I get to Australia to see it the whole bloody lot will have dissolved
T5	Claim 449 491	It’s no wonder he should find it worrying,
T7	Claim 610 714	Last year, no fewer than 600 academic papers were published on the subject, so it must be serious, right
T8	Premise 717 947	First referenced in a peer-reviewed study in Nature in 2003, it has since been endorsed by scientists from numerous learned institutions including the Royal Society, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the IPCC
T9	Premise 949 1185	Even the great David Attenborough — presenter of the Great Barrier Reef series — has vouched for its authenticity: ‘If the temperature rises up by two degrees and the acidity by a measurable amount, lots of species of coral will die out
T13	Claim 1266 1436	Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath
T14	Claim 1438 1530	First it will kill off all the calcified marine life, such as shellfish, corals and plankton
T15	Claim 1532 1713	Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death
T16	Claim 1716 1752	Or so runs the scaremongering theory
T17	Claim 1754 1792	The reality may be rather more prosaic
T18	MajorClaim 1794 2015	Ocean acidification — the evidence increasingly suggests — is a trivial, misleadingly named, and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political, ideological and financial reasons
T19	Claim 2018 2062	Some of us have suspected this for some time
T20	Premise 2064 2217	According to Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, long one of ocean acidification theory’s fiercest critics, the term is ‘just short of propaganda’
T21	Premise 2219 2338	The pH of the world’s oceans ranges between 7.5 and 8.3 — well above the acid zone (which starts below ‘neutral’ pH7) —
T23	Claim 2428 2523	‘Acid’ was chosen, Moore believes, because it has ‘strong negative connotations for most people
T24	Claim 2527 2575	Matt Ridley, too, has been scathing on the topic
T25	Premise 2612 2742	‘Ocean acidification looks suspiciously like a back-up plan by the environmental pressure groups in case the climate fails to warm
T28	Claim 2949 3231	To the alarmist camp, of course, this is yet further evidence that ‘deniers’ are heartless, anti-scientific conspiracy theorists who don’t read peer-reviewed papers and couldn’t give a toss if the world’s marine life is dissolved in a pool of acid due to man’s selfishness and greed
T29	Claim 3233 3348	Unfortunately for the doom-mongers, we sceptics have just received some heavy fire-support from a neutral authority
T30	Premise 3351 3503	Howard Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject
T31	Claim 3505 3545	His verdict could hardly be more damning
T32	Premise 3547 3718	The methodology used by the studies was often flawed; contrary studies suggesting that ocean acidification wasn’t a threat had sometimes had difficulty finding a publisher
T33	Premise 3720 3840	There was, he said, an ‘inherent bias’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘doom and gloom stories’
T34	Claim 3843 3927	Ocean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start
T35	Premise 3929 4110	In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels
T36	Premise 4144 4275	Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information
T37	Premise 4277 4391	Their chart only started in 1988 but, as Wallace knew, there were records dating back to at least 100 years before
T38	Premise 4393 4483	So why had they ignored the real-world evidence in favour of computer-modelled projections
T39	Premise 4640 4709	there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century
T40	Claim 4758 4807	it wouldn’t be a disaster for a number of reasons
T42	Premise 4909 5011	marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels
T43	Premise 5013 5110	second, they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change
T44	Premise 5112 5195	third, seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH
T45	Premise 5197 5323	fourth, if oceans do become warmer due to ‘climate change’, the effect will be for them to ‘outgas’ CO2, not absorb more of it
T46	Premise 5326 5508	Finally, and perhaps most damningly, Moore quotes a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life
T47	Premise 5510 5736	The impact on calcification, metabolism, growth, fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units (beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century) is beneficial, not damaging
T48	Claim 5738 5805	Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification
T49	Claim 5808 5963	Given all this, you might well ask why our learned institutions, government departments and media outlets have put so much effort into pretending otherwise
T51	Claim 6177 6290	To those of us who have been studying the global warming scare in some detail, the answer is depressingly obvious
T52	MajorClaim 6292 6461	It’s because in the last decade or so, the climate change industry has become so vast and all encompassing, employing so many people, it simply cannot be allowed to fail
T53	Premise 6532 6575	it’s now worth an astonishing $1.5 trillion
T54	Claim 6626 6736	If the scare goes away, then all bets are off, because the entire global decarbonisation business relies on it
T55	Premise 6738 7084	The wind parks, the carbon sequestration projects, the solar farms, the biomass plantations — none of these green schemes make any kind of commercial sense unless you buy into the theory that anthropogenic CO2 is catastrophically warming the planet and that radical green measures, enforced by governmental regulation, must be adopted to avert it
T56	Claim 7087 7170	It’s no coincidence that the ocean acidification narrative began in the early 2000s
T58	Premise 7279 7339	While CO2 levels were continuing to rise, temperatures weren
T59	Premise 7343 7627	Hence the need for a fallback position — an environmental theory which would justify the massively expensive and disruptive ongoing decarbonisation programme so assiduously championed by politicians, scientists, green campaigners and anyone making money out of the renewables business
T60	Claim 7629 7674	Ocean acidification fitted the bill perfectly
T62	Claim 7731 7744	No it doesn’t
T63	MajorClaim 7846 7961	in many environmental fields, the science is being abused and distorted to promote a political and financial agenda
T64	Claim 7963 8047	Perhaps it’s about time our supposed ‘conspiracy theories’ were taken more seriously
