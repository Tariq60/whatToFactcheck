T3	MajorClaim 155 216	There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record
T7	Premise 438 556	Arctic sea ice this January averaged 5.17 million square miles, the lowest for the month in the 38-year sea ice record
T8	Premise 603 692	That is 100,000 square miles less than the previous January record low set just last year
T9	Premise 695 778	January air temperatures climbed above average over nearly all of the Arctic Ocean,
T10	Premise 833 931	In some parts of the Arctic, temperatures reached a whopping 9 degrees above average for the month
T11	Premise 934 1047	At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said
T15	Claim 1392 1424	It can affect weather in the U.S
T16	Claim 1427 1552	The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming
T18	Premise 1622 1786	Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline
T20	Premise 1947 2051	Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year, and the link to man-made global warming there is not clear
T21	Premise 2087 2190	Using paleoclimatic data, studies suggest sea ice is shrinking to levels not seen in thousands of years
