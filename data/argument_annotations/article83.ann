T1	MajorClaim 146 245	Global warming has not accelerated temperature rise in the bulk atmosphere in more than two decades
T2	Claim 405 578	by removing the climate effects of volcanic eruptions early on in the satellite temperature record it showed virtually no change in the rate of warming since the early 1990s
T3	Premise 644 712	climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high
T4	Claim 745 787	This recent paper bolsters that conclusion
T5	Premise 817 949	the rate of warming has been 0.096 degrees Celsius per decade after “the removal of volcanic cooling in the early part of the record
T7	Claim 1044 1079	The study is sure to be contentious
T8	Premise 1115 1178	climate models exaggerate global warming in the bulk atmosphere
T9	Premise 1306 1401	his results reinforce his claim that climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere
T10	Claim 1444 1532	Models are too sensitive to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere
T11	Premise 1545 1689	From our observations we calculated that value as 1.1 C (almost 2° Fahrenheit), while climate models estimate that value as 2.3 C (about 4.1° F)
T12	Claim 1707 1887	While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations, few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves
T13	Premise 2017 2153	the “overestimation” was “partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations
T14	Claim 2157 2258	Christy’s removal of volcanic-driven cooling from satellite temperature data could also draw scrutiny
T15	Premise 2260 2309	The study also removed El Nino and La Nina cycles
T17	Claim 2473 2659	climate models need to be retooled to better reflect conditions in the actual climate, while policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered
T18	Premise 2663 2848	Two major volcanoes — El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 — caused global average temperature to dip as a result of volcanic ash, soot and debris reflecting sunlight back into space
T19	Claim 2851 3028	Those eruptions meant there was more subsequent warming in the following years, making the rate of warming appear to be rising as a result of man-made emissions or other factors
T20	Premise 3046 3242	Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend
T21	Claim 3261 3379	While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend
