T1	Claim 133 195	The United States is witnessing a massive, dangerous heat wave
T3	Claim 480 557	This will, inevitably, lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days
T5	MajorClaim 939 1197	heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection
T8	Premise 1570 1663	‘heat waves’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball
T9	Claim 1683 1770	when a planet warms, the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves
T10	Claim 1871 2168	Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature, such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate, where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change
T11	Claim 2188 2344	for extreme heat and cold events, changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions
T13	Premise 2508 2572	U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,”
T16	Claim 2839 3066	Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow
T17	Claim 3070 3265	However, pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather, it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event
T18	Premise 3280 3424	specific attribution requires active research, and an attention to the actual temperatures, duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon
T19	Claim 3461 3514	there are always heat waves, even in a stable climate
T23	Claim 4245 4369	With every heat wave, probably the number one question is, is it climate change, or is it not? Well the answer is, it’s both
T24	Claim 4461 4526	We get heat waves naturally, but climate change is amping them up
T26	Claim 4934 5063	this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland
T27	Premise 5065 5232	She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis
T28	Premise 5234 5382	That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change
