T1	Premise 73 150	The first time my father’s basement flooded, it was shortly after he moved in
T10	Claim 872 960	Ask nearly anyone in the Miami area about flooding and they’ll have an anecdote to share
T12	Premise 1032 1054	The data backs them up
T17	Claim 1671 1737	One reason is that water levels here are rising especially quickly
T18	Premise 1739 1887	The most frequently-used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15-25cm (6-10in) above 1992 levels by 2030, and 79-155cm (31-61in) by 2100
T19	Premise 2053 2127	many of south Florida’s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough
T20	Premise 2140 2264	not only more flooding, but challenges for the infrastructure that residents depend on every day, from septic tanks to wells
T21	Premise 2267 2367	The consequences of sea level rise are going to occur way before the high tide reaches your doorstep
T22	Claim 2528 2558	it poses particular risks here
T23	Premise 2593 2681	Miami has the most to lose in terms of financial assets of any coastal city in the world
T26	Premise 3004 3053	population of all three counties here was growing
T27	Premise 3176 3254	Florida has more residents at risk from climate change than any other US state
T28	Premise 3286 3348	south Florida is home to historic properties which are at risk
T29	Claim 3419 3452	It has more property at risk, too
T30	Premise 3476 3590	developers had 1.6 million sq ft (149,000 sq m) of office space and 1.8 million of retail space under construction
T34	Premise 3938 3995	Many of the wealthiest people in the US reside in Florida
T42	Premise 5080 5138	The 105 miles (169km) of roads being raised in Miami Beach
T47	Claim 5417 5458	The communities aren’t short of solutions
T50	Premise 5710 5864	Even those tasked with making their cities resilient admit that, at some point in the future, certain areas here will no longer be “viable” places to live
T51	Claim 5874 6032	the challenge is to do enough to ensure that the economy as a whole continues to thrive and that tourists still come to enjoy the sun, sand – and swelling sea
T54	Claim 6278 6451	Getting there, though, requires a shift in how everyone from mayors to taxpayers, insurers to engineers, property developers to urban planners thinks about their communities
T64	Premise 7266 7306	And the answer is: it affects everything
T65	MajorClaim 7312 7336	Sea level rise is global
T67	Premise 7592 7798	While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually
T69	Claim 7866 7903	the whole story of what residents see
T79	Claim 8998 9067	Not only are sea levels rising, but the pace seems to be accelerating
T81	Premise 9196 9280	After 2006, sea level rose faster than before – and much faster than the global rate
T88	Premise 9822 9955	Like other popular areas including Sunny Isles and Hollywood Beach, Miami Beach is a narrow barrier island with the ocean on one side
T104	Claim 11522 11578	even the worst-case estimates may turn out to be too low
T105	Premise 11593 11799	researchers recently discovered that ice is melting more rapidly than expected from both Antarctica and Greenland, plus gained a better understanding of how melting ice sheets actually affect sea-level rise
T108	Premise 11990 12091	coastal communities are already experiencing more storms and extremely high tides known as king tides
T111	Claim 12324 12357	rising seas heighten their effect
T117	Claim 12907 12969	Even without floods, the rising water table affects everything
T118	Premise 12971 13016	The cities here are built on porous limestone
T119	Premise 13018 13097	The water doesn’t just come over seawalls; it seeps up from beneath the streets
T120	Premise 13113 13243	the drinking water in south Florida comes from aquifers, and these are finding their fresh water pushed further and further inland
T126	Claim 13733 13763	Another issue is beach erosion
T127	Premise 13765 13971	Florida’s sand may be one of its biggest draws for tourist dollars, but it, too, is vulnerable: though sand never stays put, rising sea levels and worsening storms mean the need to replenish is intensifying
T129	Claim 14171 14240	another part of the problem is that south Florida is built on a swamp
T131	Premise 14436 14533	Residents cut canals to drain inland areas, using the fill to raise the land and build properties
T132	Premise 14535 14601	These canals are now open doors for tidal flooding and storm surge
T133	Premise 14603 14698	They also cut down mangrove forests and levelled sand dunes – both natural barriers to flooding
T143	Premise 15522 15549	But we’re not doing nothing
T144	Claim 15553 15569	That’s point one
T147	Premise 15729 15836	Purple means an area is likely to be underwater at 2ft (61cm) of sea level rise; orange means it’s possible
T148	Premise 15838 15900	A surprisingly small amount of the map is splashed with colour
T151	Premise 16105 16201	these areas are not in places you’d expect – and we’ll have time to address some of these issues
T153	Claim 16301 16338	Not every community might be so lucky
T154	Premise 16493 16656	the same 2ft (61cm) rise could put streets and most properties of an entire square-mile swathe underwater – not insignificant for a city measuring just 30 sq miles
T165	Premise 17795 17842	Fort Lauderdale is dubbed the Venice of America
T167	Claim 17997 18094	For both Fort Lauderdale and other communities across south Florida, the main problem is drainage
T168	Premise 18096 18179	The systems here were designed to let stormwater drain into the ocean when it rains
T172	Premise 18429 18570	With sea levels now often higher than the exits to the run-off pipes, saltwater is instead running up through the system and into the streets
T173	Premise 18626 18699	it can breach the seawall, flood people’s yards and flow down to the road
T174	Premise 18754 18821	right now, it is lower than the water level, meaning it can't drain
T214	Claim 22282 22330	It’s not just residents who need to make changes
T217	Premise 22485 22530	getting the funds is just the first challenge
T222	Premise 22857 22897	there’s both a public and a private cost
T230	Premise 23679 23857	Roads are being raised, too, sometimes by up to 2ft (61cm), to an elevation which the Southeast Florida Climate Compact’s projections put as a likely sea level height around 2065
T234	Claim 24159 24183	It’s an ambitious agenda
T235	Claim 24189 24212	it’s one that’s working
T236	Premise 24214 24289	Areas where roads have been raised and pumps installed have been much drier
T241	Premise 24586 24603	But they can fail
T243	Premise 24839 24887	the restaurant flooded, with diners stuck inside
T245	Premise 24954 25168	According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which runs a national flood insurance programme for at-risk business and property owners like Gallo, anything below street level is considered a basement
T250	Claim 25604 25655	resilience also can be built into existing projects
T251	Premise 25657 25796	A lot of public infrastructure is built to last for at least 50 or 75 years, and that means planning for what the world will look like then
T256	Premise 26142 26220	a 4,200ft-long (1280m) tunnel that runs from the Port of Miami to highway I395
T257	Premise 26238 26324	its main objective was to re-route lorries that previously went through downtown Miami
T263	Premise 26747 26830	a barrier island where Biscayne Bay and the ocean meet, just east of downtown Miami
T267	Premise 27201 27319	The plant already had a $500 million project on the go, making changes to comply with new Clean Water Act requirements
T274	Premise 28084 28195	The new chlorine building, currently under construction, is designed to start at 16ft (4.8m) above ground level
T275	Claim 28222 28283	Private developers will need to think about these issues, too
T278	Claim 28534 28585	But many developers aren’t thinking to 2050 or 2100
T280	Premise 28695 28799	a lot of investors are foreign or periodic visitors, that timeframe is far shorter – a few years at most
T282	Claim 28965 29078	Until regulations enforce common building standards, few private developers are likely to adopt resilient designs
T301	Claim 31268 31320	Thinking about any of this is a relatively new trend
T302	Premise 31399 31486	the topic only saw real traction among local governments and businesses a few years ago
T304	Premise 31563 31742	Most officials say that the Compact, signed in 2010, has been a major driver in helping local governments collect the data they need and coordinate together on what to do about it
T305	Premise 31939 32034	The Florida governor is a climate change sceptic and has directed attention away from the issue
T307	Premise 32125 32425	Ignoring the issue now appears to pervade the highest levels of US government: the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief doubts whether carbon dioxide plays a primary role in climate change, while President Trump recently signed an executive order overturning emissions-slashing regulations
T314	Claim 33437 33496	Yet the impact from these changes won’t stop at party lines
T315	Premise 33498 33540	Even President Trump’s family isn’t immune
T316	Premise 33542 33570	Three feet of sea level rise
T319	Premise 33890 33927	The water doesn’t care about politics
T323	Claim 34237 34382	Some of the communities in south Florida doing the most to adapt to the effects of sea level rise are doing so largely because of public pressure
T324	Premise 34384 34458	In 1993, Miami-Dade put together its first plan to reduce carbon emissions
T326	Premise 34544 34681	a hearing on the county’s budget was dominated by one resident after another asking why the county wasn’t doing more about sea level rise
T338	Claim 35852 36100	Despite how awareness of the issue has grown in some communities – particularly those, like Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, that have seen the most flooding – it’s still common for sea-level rise to get shunted to the end of the list of priorities
T356	Premise 37634 37781	As shown by the Compact chart’s steep orange line, if emissions continue to rise, adaptation will become increasingly difficult – if not impossible
T357	Premise 37839 37906	that, of course, can’t be controlled by a community or region alone
T358	Premise 37909 38013	Climate change mitigation to reduce greenhouse gases is a global issue and has to be dealt with globally
