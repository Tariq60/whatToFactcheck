T1	Claim 124 204	National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities
T2	Premise 206 327	For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up
T3	Premise 329 496	U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014
T4	Claim 499 638	Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers
T5	Claim 640 670	This is a boon to human health
T6	MajorClaim 673 817	But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants
T8	Premise 833 910	Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas
T9	Premise 912 1011	Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor
T10	Claim 1013 1084	CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants
T11	Premise 1086 1167	It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature
T12	Claim 1170 1362	Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions
T13	Claim 1364 1583	But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—
T15	Claim 1659 1817	The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world
T16	Premise 1820 1957	In 2013 the level of U.S. farm output was about 2.7 times its 1948 level, and productivity was growing at an average annual rate of 1.52%
T17	Premise 1959 2092	From 2001 to 2013, world-wide, global output of total crop and livestock commodities was expanding at an average rate of 2.52% a year
T18	Claim 2095 2254	This higher food security reduces poverty and increases well being and self-sufficiency everywhere, especially in the poorest parts of the developing countries
T19	Claim 2256 2386	Along with better plant varieties, cropping practices and fertilizer, CO2 has contributed to this welcome increase in productivity
T20	Premise 2389 2593	The increase of atmospheric CO2 following the Industrial Revolution also has facilitated the expansion of natural vegetation into what had been barren areas, such as the edges of the Sahara and the Arctic
T21	Premise 2595 2716	According to the U.N., the world will add 2.5 billion people over the next 30 years, most of them in developing countries
T22	Claim 2718 2831	Feeding these people and assuring them a comfortable living standard should be among our highest moral priorities
T23	Claim 2833 2899	With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge can and will be met
T24	Claim 2902 2962	National policies must make economic and environmental sense
